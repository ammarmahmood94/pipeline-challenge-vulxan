"A one-two punch of new storms packed with snow, sleet, and rain will move through the Northeast in the span of days with more winter systems potentially lined up for the weekend and again next week.

The first of the systems will arrive in the East Coast on Tuesday afternoon, Feb. 11, and then move north, the National Weather Service says.

The heaviest snowfall is expected in the southern parts of the Northeast, including in and around Washington, DC, with widespread totals of 3 to 6 inches. (See the first image above from AccuWeather for the latest projections, which were released Tuesday morning.)

For precipitation types by region, click on the second image above.

Prior to the arrival of the new storm, Monday, Feb. 10 will be mainly sunny and seasonably cold.

After the first storm moves out, a new system packed with snow, ice, and rain is on track for Wednesday, Feb. 12 into Thursday, Feb. 13 that is also expected to move from the south to the north.

Similar to the first system, the second of the storms will arrive first in southern locations of the Northeast before tracking north Wednesday night into about midday Thursday before exiting from New England.

The current outlook calls for generally light snowfall amounts, with most areas seeing accumulation farther north and inland in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New England.

Snowfall projections for the second system can be viewed by clicking on the third image above.

The second storm will also bring widespread ice, with significant icing possible in the areas shown in the darker shade of pink in the fourth image above.

After the systems moves out, the outlook for Valentine's Day on Friday, Feb. 14 calls for mostly sunny skies and seasonable temperatures, but yet another storm is possible for the weekend.

But then another storm is expected Saturday, Feb. 15 into Sunday, Feb. 16 and then another toward the end of Presidents Day week.

""We have a third winter storm on the horizon late this week and this weekend, and possibly a fourth winter storm early next week. This has been a busy and challenging stretch for plow truck drivers, utility crews, and airport staff, and many others trying to stay one step ahead of these winter storms.”",2025-02-11T12:02:00+00:00,https://www.newsbreak.com/daily-voice-525087/3802041384778-flurry-of-storms-back-to-back-systems-near-with-more-to-come,bf23adc4e1614fb695c4978f5ad2fca4

"The Chiefs were supposed to be on a path to destiny. Conventional wisdom saw them as fashionable favorites following a 15-2 run to a Super Bowl ticket that featured 12 final scores with single-digit differences. The ridiculous slate of triumphs on close shaves seemed to signify their resilience and resolve under pressure. For all their frailties (and they had many), they appeared to be invincible. And, needless to say, the narrative fit perfectly into the notion of quarterback Patrick Mahomes as a singular force who could, and would, invariably turn abject failure into sustained success.

Unfortunately for the Chiefs, Super Bowl LIX showed that they were just as susceptible to stumbling as most other would-be contenders. And, boy, did they swoon in the big stage. It was not an unfamiliar sight, to be sure; they also suffered a beatdown in Super Bowl LV, at the hands of the Buccaneers that had all-time-great Tom Brady under center. That said, their performance the other day proved to be record-setting — of the worst kinds. They wilted in the face of a smothering Eagles defense that was notably underscored by an utter lack of exotic dimensions — and none more than Mahomes.

Hindsight always makes for perfect vision, but it tells a cautionary tale for gridiron fans all the same. The Chiefs, whom followers of the National Football League either love or love to hate, littered the 2024 landscape with warning signs of their infirmities; viewed from a different lens, their crunchtime achievements blew smoke into a veritable House of Cards. Time and again, Mahomes rescued them and snatched victory from the throes of defeat. In Super Bowl LIX, however, he was arguably the biggest reason for their failure; he was shaky from opening kickoff, and wound up with a six-of-14 line for a horrific 33 yards marked by two interceptions in the first half. It was 24-0 for the Eagles by then, with no indication a history-making comeback was in the cards.

When the battle smoke cleared, Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts was awarded the Peter Rozell Trophy — in and of itself a remarkable repudiation of Mahomes’ reputation as a miracle worker given his counterpart’s workmanlike numbers. Make no mistake, however; the defensive line coordinated by Vic Fangio played a starring role in the 40-22 obliteration, especially with running back Saquon Barkley limited to 57 rushing yards on 25 carries. Perhaps they relied too much on their co-captain to bail them out even as they could not provide him with halfway-decent protection; their running game was all but nonexistent.

Looking ahead, the Chiefs are at a crossroads. They began their season with an eye toward becoming the first in the league to craft a three-peat, only to end it with uncertainty. Mahomes remains a critical difference maker, but they would do well to surround him with ample help. Else, they may again find themselves dealing with What Ifs and Could Have Beens in an ultimately futile aim to return to the top.

"Welcome to the Splash Zone, the quickest way to get your day started off right. We bring you a rundown of Miami Dolphins news from the last 24 hours.

After a very disappointing 2024 season, the Miami Dolphins enter a crucial offseason where they are not in the best of shape with the salary cap and plenty key players set to hit free agency. First things first, Chris Grier has to get the salary cap cleared up. Whether that is cutting players or restructuring some contracts, Grier and the team have a lot of work to do. There are several starters set to hit free agency, like safety Jevon Holland. Will the Dolphins let another young, promising player leave or will they finally understand they have to start keeping their own talent? Then there are starters like guards Liam Eichenberg and Robert Jones who should be easily replaceable.

You can check out that story here, and the rest of the day’s round-up below.

"Ethereum’s journey from a $0.31 initial price in 2015 to its current multi-thousand-dollar valuation took nearly a decade. Solana (SOL), another major player, surged over 10,000% since its 2020 debut, with analysts eyeing another potential 10,000% leap by 2025. Yet a new contender, Rexas Finance (RXS), priced at $0.20 in its ongoing presale, is gaining attention for its potential to outpace both.

Industry experts highlight RXS’s unique focus on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization—a sector poised to disrupt trillion-dollar markets like real estate, commodities, and art. With $44.3 million already raised and a confirmed $0.25 listing price later in 2025, Rexas Finance is positioning itself as the next breakthrough in the crypto market.

Rexas Finance targets the $121.2 trillion global commodities market, the $486 trillion financial assets sector, and the $65 billion art industry through blockchain-based tokenization. By converting physical assets like real estate or gold into digital tokens, RXS enables fractional ownership, dismantling traditional barriers. A retail investor in Asia can now own a 5% stake in a commercial property in Paris, earning rental income without hefty capital or cross-border hurdles. This shift democratizes access, letting users trade tokenized assets instantly, 24/7, from any device.

The platform’s ERC-20 token, RXS, powers this ecosystem. With a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens, its allocation prioritizes accessibility: 50% for presale, 22.5% for staking rewards, and 15% for liquidity. Unlike projects reliant on venture capital, Rexas opted for a public presale, letting everyday investors lead this revolution. Stages 1-11 sold out rapidly, raising $41 million, while Stage 12 offers tokens at $0.20—a 6.6x jump from the initial $0.03.

Rexas Finance’s suite of user-friendly tools eliminates technical complexities. The Rexas Token Builder lets anyone convert real-world assets into tradable tokens within minutes. For instance, a gold mine owner in South Africa can tokenize 10% of their reserves, offering global investors fractional shares. The QuickMint Bot simplifies this further via Telegram or Discord, enabling token creation through simple commands.

The Rexas Launchpad supports fundraising for tokenized projects, while Rexas Estate streamlines real estate investments. AI-driven features like GenAI and AI Shield enhance security and user experience, ensuring smart contracts are robust and transactions transparent. These tools collectively bridge blockchain and physical assets, setting Rexas apart in a crowded crypto market.

Rexas Finance’s presale momentum underscores investor confidence. Having raised $44.3 million, the project is CertiK-audited—a gold standard for blockchain security—and listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, boosting visibility to over 100 million monthly users. A $1 million giveaway offers 20 winners $50,000 each, incentivizing early participation.

Moreover, an 850K RXS buy that mirrors hedge fund tactics: identify, accumulate, profit has been recorded on etherscan. RXS’s narrative is shifting from “hidden gem” to “blue-chip”—act before the relabel. With a 2025 launch slated on three top-tier exchanges, RXS is projected to hit $10 in 2025—a 50x surge from its current price. This trajectory mirrors Solana’s historic climbs but within a fraction of the time, fueled by RWA tokenization’s untapped potential.

Rexas Finance (RXS) merges blockchain innovation with real-world utility, offering a tangible solution to illiquid markets. Its presale success, coupled with a clear roadmap to a $0.25 listing, positions RXS as a frontrunner to eclipse Ethereum’s growth timeline. For investors seeking the next exponential gain, Rexas Finance presents a rare opportunity to join a revolution reshaping global asset ownership—one click at a time.

"Everything indicates that this week we will meet a new investor in Korona Kielce. It should be presented on Tuesday, which was announced by the press office of the City Hall from the Świętokrzyskie Province.

New investors are looking for several clubs competing in the Premier League and in this group there is Korona Kielce. For several weeks there have been sounding quite similar information confirming that discussions on this subject are ongoing.



- We have been conducting an intensive process for two or three months. We are in advanced conversations with two entities in the sphere of information exchange. The first quarter is a period for a key decision whether Korona Kielce will find a business partner who will take over financial and organizational responsibility - said the Mayor of the City from the Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship Agata Wojda in a January conversation with Radio Kielce.



After that, the club has been recapitalized by redemption of the company of debts in the form of PLN 5.5 million towards the Municipal Sports and Recreation Center and 2.3 million zlotys arrears for the city due to real estate tax.

"Former Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho said today in court that in May 2014, he suggested to the then banker Ricardo Salgado to negotiate with the creditors of the Espírito Santo group (GES) a “ordained bankruptcy” of this entity.
The head of government at the date of resolution of Banco Espírito Santo (BES), in the summer of 2014, said that the recommendation was given after, in a meeting with Ricardo Salgado and two other elements of the institution, they requested that the state implements a GES support program.
“This meeting reflected Dr. Ricardo Salgado's request to see the government, I will not direct, but give guidance to Caixa Geral de Depósitos and, eventually if this were necessary, to give some positive contribution to a restructuring plan with other banks [ …] For a financial support program to the Espírito Santo Group, ”said Pedro Passos Coelho, by witnessing in the trial of the main proceedings of BES/GES collapse.
In addition to financial support, BES management would intend to make “an exchange of assets” to manage those who could “be pressuring the group's financial health”.
""My reaction was very practical: I transmitted that this plan had no viability,"" he said.
In this context, the then Prime Minister gave ""a suggestion to avoid the disordered bankruptcy of GES,"" proposing to Ricardo Salgado to gather ""his most relevant creditors"" and negotiate ""with them an orderly bankruptcy.""
Pedro Passos Coelho also recalled that in April 2014 he had already had a first meeting with former BES president, in which he had shown “discomfort with the way the governor of Banco de Portugal read with BES”.
""It was well known that Banco de Portugal was committed to guaranteeing a replacement of BES administration, not helping the confusion between the situation that was reasonably known to the Bank's Espírito Santo group,"" he added.
The process currently has 18 defendants, including former BES president Ricardo Salgado, 80 years old and diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.
Ricardo Salgado is responsible for about 60 crimes, including one of criminal association and several of active corruption in the private sector and qualified scam.
The Public Prosecution Service estimates that acts allegedly practiced between 2009 and 2014 by the 18 defendants, former BES and other GES entities, caused losses of 11.8 billion euros to the bank and the group.
The trial began on October 30, 2024.",2025-02-11T12:15:23+00:00,https://jornaleconomico.sapo.pt/noticias/bes-ges-passos-coelho-propos-a-ricardo-salgado-que-negociasse-falencia-ordenada-do-grupo/,29c48773cf2546a59788d890aa668d0f

"Every time a new episode of Samay Raina’s talent show India's Got Latent drops on YouTube, headlines are made. May it be because of Rakhi Sawant having a fit and throwing a chair on stage or because of a comedian taking a dig at Deepika Padukone’s battle with depression. Currently the show is in the news thanks to inappropriate remarks made by YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia aka BeerBiceps, who joined the judges panel for a bonus episode recently. But did you know that the ‘sex with parents’ question, which Ranveer is under fire for, was actually copied? Here's the origin story.

For those who didn’t get a chance to catch the bonus episode of India's Got Latent, which has now been taken down from YouTube, Ranveer asked a contestant, “Would you rather watch your parents have sex every day for the rest of your life or join in once to make it stop forever?” Not just Ranveer but even Samay and his show received a lot of backlash for this particular question. This was followed by complaints being filed against Ranveer, Samay and social media influencer Apoorva Makhija, who was also a judge on the episode. Well, this ‘joke’ was copied from OG Crew’s Truth or Drink, where host Sammy Walsh asked the same question.

Soon after this video went viral, several netizens shared their opinions in the comment section below. Are they less upset now that they know the question was copied and not a BeerBiceps original? Well, not so much. One social media user claimed, “Wat ever, if it is original or copied. Hello should have thought n had some brains before asking such questions,” whereas another pointed out, “He came with research thinking it’s like any other podcast but actually messed up bad !!” Another netizen who felt intensely about the incident wrote, “Jo hua galat hua. He should be jailed for atleast a few days/weeks and the show ""India's Got Latent"" should be given strict warning or ban for weeks/months.”

According to latest buzz, police reached te podcaster's house today. One day ago, Ranveer Allahbadia took to his official Instagram handle to apologise, and wrote, “I shouldn’t have said what I said on India’s got latent. I’m sorry.” Do you think he will be forgiven any time soon?",2025-02-11T12:23:53+00:00,https://www.hindustantimes.com/htcity/cinema/ranveer-allahbadia-s-sex-with-parents-question-on-samay-raina-s-indias-got-latent-was-copied-here-s-the-original-101739275009040-amp.html,310ede4d5a6d4b56bd9f9204f30584f6

"Against the background of the closure of factories and twisting environmental nuts, the volume of sales of electric vehicles also did not increase and continue to lag behind the forecasts of analysts. And impenetrable ""optimists"" from the ruling European parties rely on the absolutely correctly chosen vector of their policy.

So, the other day, the head of the Association of manufacturers of E-Mobility Europa E-Mobiles, Chris Heron, claimed that the EU authorities should continue the course to tighten the “green” agenda. This supposedly good goal will resume state support for the market of components for electric vehicles, which will increase the sales of electric cars.

It is not easy not only to the automobile market, but also to the auto giants themselves. After all, in new realities, according to the norms and rules, already in 2025, serious fines of up to 15 billion euros for exceeding the emissions are threatened. And more than half of these fines will have to be paid by Volkswagen. Against this background, concerns sometimes have to choose the most pleasant solution - to cut the production of classic machines and make discounts on the ""trains"".

However, the trend of rejection of the environmental agenda did not appear yesterday. The collapse of the demand for the ""trains"" was outlined about a year ago, when all subsidies and support ended at once for choosing such types of vehicles. In Germany alone, sales immediately collapsed by 30.6%. A similar picture was in other countries.

According to the associate professor of the Department of Economic Theory of the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, Peter Arefiev, even if the “green” agenda prevails in Europe, it will become ruined for the Europeans themselves. We suggest that the inhabitants of the European continent will suddenly be massively transferred to electric cars, this will inevitably lead to an increase in electricity consumption by 20%, Arefiev believes. And taking into account the fact that the cost of electricity to the EU has increased more multiplying in previous years, such a transition to electric cars will cost the European economy very expensive.",2025-02-11T07:00:00+00:00,https://auto.mail.ru/article/101670-pochemu-elektromobili-gubitelnyi-dlya-buduschego-evropyi/,f9a9eba5a1184b09b050167066cfb4ef
"Former union minister and Chandigarh MP Manish Tewari today sought clarification from the government of India over the undocumented Indians living in the United States.

Raising the matter in the parliament today, Tewari disclosed that there are 7.25 lakh undocumented Indians in the US. He said, of these, 24,000 are in the custody of the US government and 487 of them have been served the final deportation orders. He said, 200 of them have been positively identified as Indian citizens.

He asked the government as to whether these people would be handcuffed, shackled, and brought back in US military planes completely deprived of their basic human dignity and their human rights.

“At that point when I condemned the statement of the External Affairs minister, which sought to justify the US behaviour by saying that these were standard operating procedures, my mike was shut off”, he said.

The senior Congress leader observed that this was not a BJP-Congress issue as this is an issue which pertains to the self-respect of India.

He wished that the BJP members should have also joined him in condemning this extremely reprehensible behaviour, which has been meted out to our fellow citizens.

He said it was extremely unfortunate and regrettable that when he raised the issue of Indians who are in detention in the US and are being deported back to India in handcuffs and shackles his mike was shut off.",2025-02-11T11:28:22+00:00,https://yespunjab.com/chandigarh-mp-tewari-seeks-goi-clarification-over-undocumented-indians-in-the-us/,3bfe1226070440aaa54dfcf307163610

"Armie Hammer’s fall from grace as one of Hollywood’s rising stars has been well documented after allegations of abuse were levelled against him.

The actor starred in films such as The Social Network, The Lone Ranger, The Man from UNCLE and received a Golden Globe nomination for his portrayal of Oliver in the romantic drama Call Me By Your Name.

But in 2021, a number of women came forward with allegations of abuse against the actor, and his professional life came to a standstill.

Hammer has always denied the allegations and following an investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) no criminal charges against him were pursued.

However, it led to an hiatus in his Hollywood career after he was dropped by his talent agency.

During this time, he said he worked as a timeshare salesman in the Cayman Islands and an apartment block manager to earn a living.

Now the 38-year-old is returning to the entertainment industry with a new film project, a western called Frontier Crucible.

And in a podcast with journalist and broadcaster Louis Theroux he talks candidly about his past, addresses the accusations made against him and speaks about his plans for the future.

We take a look at what he has to say.

The actor spoke openly about a previous text message exchange in which he was said to have written, “I am 100% a cannibal”, and that he had “cut the heart out of a living animal before and eaten it while still warm”.

Hammer said: “I think the most important context to give these things is they are one side of a conversaton.

“As you’ll notice, of all of the text messages that were released, the person who released them, their side was cut out of the entire conversation.

“It makes it look like I was just rambling to myself.

“I mean, if you look, there’s really no response in any of these.”

He added: “Any digitally altered evidence is immediately inadmissible because you have no context.

“That could have been a very funny conversation between two people who were joking and pushing each other and egging each other on in the way that sometimes you see comedians pushing the boundary further and further when they’re having a conversation.

“I’m not going to argue the messages.”

Pressed by Theroux on whether he actually is a cannibal, he said: “You know what you have to do to actually be a cannibal?

“You have to actually eat human flesh. So, no.”

But when asked if he had eaten an animal heart while still warm, he said: “One of the traditions is you take a bite out of the heart and you’ve got all your buddies around you, they’re goading you on.

“It’s sort of like a almost overly-charged male rite of passage when you go hunting for your first time.

“Everyone that I know who went hunting for their first time had to do something similar.”

Hammer was accused of sexual assault by his ex-girlfriend Efrosina Angelovai in 2021, who posted on an Instagram account screenshots of sexually-charged text messages he was alleged to have sent.

Two other women also came forward accusing him of emotional and physical abuse during their relationships.

Hammer has denied the allegations and his legal team stated at the time “the assertions about Mr Hammer are patently untrue.

“Any interactions with any partner of his were completely consensual in that they were fully discussed, agreed upon, and mutually participatory”.

Speaking about them on the podcast, he said the messages were posted “out of context”.

He added: “The other part of that conversation was, you know, how much the other person enjoyed it, the things that they liked about it, the things that the next time they want to do differently or more of.

“You know, I mean, this was a back-and-forth conversation between two people who were expressing their sexuality in a way that they both agreed to and consented to.

“You know, I mean, there’s a big part of the BDSM [bondage, domination, sadism and masochism] world that when taken out of context, looks not great.”

Asked about the other women who came forward with allegations, he said: “All of those things were also investigated by the LAPD.

“A lot of this, I think, was put very well, where they said, hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

“And by the way, I’m very quick to admit that I was selfish and inconsiderate and an asshole and a cad and I used people to make me feel better.

“People were sort of like my bags of dope with skin on them, you know?

“I left a lot of people in that wake very angry at me for my behaviour, which by the way was asshole behaviour, there’s no way around that.

“Does it make me a d**k? Absolutely, like I have no problem admitting that I was a d**k, but that’s not illegal, you know?”

Hammer married Elizabeth Chambers in 2010, the owner of a bakery chain and televison personality.

The couple have two children but separated in 2020 and divorced in 2023.

Hammer admitted he had been unfaithful during his marriage.

Speaking to Theroux, he said: “I would say that I pursued an affair because things were not going well.

“You know, I think what I have found is that happy people in happy relationships generally don’t have affairs.

“So that is always sort of the crescendo, and there’s always a mountain underneath that of relationship issues.

“You know, I’m certainly not here to air the dirty laundry of my marriage, but it was a classic tale of two people growing over a long course of a long marriage.

“I was married for nine years and I got married when I was 23, 24 years old – very young – and didn’t even have a firm sense or understanding of myself as you typically don’t at 24 years old.”

Hammer lost work in Hollywood on the back of the allegations in 2021 – he had to drop out of the film Shotgun Wedding with Jennifer Lopez.

He said: “All my jobs went away in the blink of an eye.

“There wasn’t a process. It just all seemed to happen overnight.

“Jobs, representation, everything just went, boom.

“It was a complete death. It was a career death. It was an ego death. It was a financial death”

But he claims this proved to be a pivotal point in his life.

“It killed off all of the bullshit,” he said, adding: “It killed off all of the pretence.

“And I spent three years and change really having to examine myself and really having to look at myself.

“Now with a sense of distance and perspective from it, it’s the greatest thing that ever happened to me.”

He said he didn’t drink alcohol for three years after the 2021 allegations and although now he will have a drink he said: “I don’t get drunk, I don’t get high, I don’t get stoned”.

He also said he attended a “trauma treatment facility” in Florida.

Hammer was asked about sexual abuse he said he endured during his teenage years.

Speaking to the digital newsletter Air Mail in 2023, he said he was sexually abused by a youth pastor.

He told Theroux on the podcast: “I don’t want to be like, okay, it all makes sense.

“I’m not a therapist, but I think that it would be very difficult not to relate that in some way with reverberating effects through the rest of your life, of anyone’s life.

“And, you know, my mom and I spent hours talking.

“There were aspects of that that I needed to look at, and I needed to process and that I needed to come to terms with and I needed to accept and I needed to move through.”",2025-02-11T12:17:12+00:00,https://inews.co.uk/culture/armie-hammer-louis-theroux-podcast-3529342,a4746d9f04404d13bd76bd50fa0a000b
"Group Newzins Hani reportedly refused to apply for a visa extension from its disputed agency, Adore. As a result, it is speculated that the reason why Newzins will have a comeback stage in Hong Kong next month, not Korea, may be due to Hani's expiration of her visa.

On the 11th, a media outlet reported that Adore recently refused to sign documents prepared by Hani to extend her visa. In a related development, an Adore official declined to comment on the Mail Business Star Today, saying, ""We can't confirm it.""

Hani, a dual Australian and Vietnamese national, needs an ""E-6 visa"" that is issued under the condition of hiring an agency in order to engage in entertainment activities in Korea. With Hani's E-6 visa reportedly expiring in early February, Hani refused to sign documents prepared by Adore to extend her visa.

However, Hani is said to be able to stay in Korea as a party to the lawsuit. However, it is not possible to perform entertainment activities, so it is expected that it will be difficult to see the entire group of Newzins in Korea for the time being.

On November 28 last year, Newzins held an emergency press conference on the termination of its exclusive contract and declared the termination of the contract with its agency, Adore. At the time, the members claimed that ""Dore has neither the will nor the ability to protect Newzins,"" and that they were terminating the contract for violation of Hive and Adore's contract.

On the other hand, Odor is in the position that the exclusive contract with Newzins is valid. ""Adore, a party to the exclusive contract, did not violate the contract and unilaterally claiming that trust was broken cannot be a reason for termination,"" Adore said.

Since then, Newzins has started its own activities by using the names Minji, Hani, Daniel, Harin, and Hyelin instead of the team name, and Adore confronted the Newzins members on December 3 last year by filing a lawsuit to confirm the validity of the exclusive contract with the court.

Amid the ongoing conflict between the two sides over exclusive contracts, Newzins changed its team name to ""NJZ"" on the 7th and announced that it will appear at Complex Live, a side event concert of ComplexCon in Hong Kong from the 21st to the 23rd of next month.

The members then announced an unusual move through a live SNS broadcast, saying, ""The stage is what we desperately wanted to do, so we will release a new song on stage right away,"" and ""We will release it on stage on the 23rd, the last day of 'Complex Con.'",2025-02-11T11:42:59+00:00,https://www.mk.co.kr/en/society/11238618,c750f3055eb148509ef7b4a6a8d37a1c

"President Donald Trump has set a bold plan in motion for America’s financial future — one that mirrors the strategies of oil-rich nations and resource-heavy economies: a sovereign wealth fund.

On February 3, 2025, Trump signed an executive order directing the creation of a U.S. sovereign wealth fund. The order mandates that the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Commerce develop a plan within 90 days, detailing funding mechanisms, investment strategies, fund structure and governance models.

• One dozen eggs in America now costs $4.15 — and $14.35 for a pound of sirloin steak. Both record highs. 3 simple ways to protect your wealth in 2025
• Home prices in America could fly through the roof in 2025 — here’s the big reason why and how to take full advantage (with as little as $10)

While the initiative is still in its early stages and specific details remain scarce, Trump is highly optimistic.

“We’re going to create a lot of wealth for the fund, and I think it’s about time this country had a sovereign wealth fund,” he told reporters.

It’s unclear how the fund would be financed, but Trump has previously suggested it could come from “tariffs and other intelligent things.”

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent echoed Trump’s enthusiasm, stating that the administration plans to “monetize the asset side of the U.S. balance sheet for the American people.” He also noted that the fund is expected to be established within the next 12 months.

Despite Trump’s confidence, the proposal has drawn skepticism.

Economist Peter Schiff, a vocal supporter of Trump during the election season, didn’t hold back in his criticism.

“Even if the U.S. government didn’t have a massive $36.5 trillion national debt, the idea of a U.S. sovereign wealth fund is not only preposterous, it’s also unconstitutional,” he wrote in a post on X. “Plus, the last thing we need is more socialism or for the U.S. government to pick winners and losers.”

Others have also raised concerns about the economic feasibility of such a fund.

“The economic rules of thumb don’t add up,” said Colin Graham, head of multiasset strategies at Robeco in London, according to Reuters. “Creating a sovereign wealth fund suggests that a country has savings that will go up and can be allocated to this.”

The U.S. government doesn’t have much in the way of savings — it has debt. A lot of it. And with ongoing budget deficits, that debt is only expected to grow.

As of this writing, the U.S. national debt stands at $36.22 trillion, raising concerns about whether a sovereign wealth fund is financially viable. Whether Trump’s sovereign wealth fund becomes a game-changing wealth-generating force or faces insurmountable challenges, the responsibility falls to all Americans to take control of their own financial future. While governments debate policy, savvy investors have always prioritized building and protecting wealth — regardless of political shifts or who occupies the White House. Here’s a look at three easy ways to get started. When it comes to building wealth, few investors have a track record as impressive as Warren Buffett. From 1964 to 2023, his company, Berkshire Hathaway, delivered a staggering total gain of 4,384,748%. Yet, despite his legendary success in picking winning companies, Buffett doesn’t believe that’s the right approach for most investors. Instead, he champions a much simpler strategy: “In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is own the S&P 500 index fund,” he famously stated at the 2020 annual Berkshire Hathaway meeting. This approach gives investors exposure to 500 of America’s largest companies across various industries, providing diversified exposure without the need for constant monitoring or active trading. Buffett believes so strongly in this strategy that he has instructed 90% of his wife’s inheritance to be invested in “a very low-cost S&P 500 index fund” after he dies. The beauty of this approach is its accessibility — anyone, regardless of wealth, can take advantage of it. Even small amounts can grow over time, and some apps even let you invest in an S&P 500 ETF with your spare change, making it easier than ever to build wealth alongside the world’s financial elite. Read more: 82% of Americans are missing out on a savings account that pays over 10 times the national average Real estate has been another powerful vehicle for long-term financial growth, and it’s a strategy that Trump himself knows well. Long before he entered politics, Trump built his fortune through high-profile real estate ventures, from luxury developments to commercial properties. Investors gravitate to real estate for good reason — well-chosen properties can generate passive income through rent while also having the potential to appreciate in value over time. Additionally, real estate serves as a proven hedge against inflation. As the cost of materials, labor, and land rises, property values often follow suit. Rental income also tends to increase, allowing landlords to offset the impact of inflation and preserve their purchasing power. The best part? These days, you don’t need to be a billionaire like Trump to take advantage of this strategy. One popular option is publicly traded real estate investment trusts (REITs), which own income-producing properties, collect rent from tenants, and distribute a portion of that income to shareholders as dividends. Another alternative is real estate crowdfunding platforms, which allow everyday investors to own shares in rental properties without the hefty down payments or the responsibilities of property management. Depending on your preferences, you can gain exposure to residential properties, grocery-anchored commercial real estate, or even farmland, all without the traditional barriers to entry. For investors looking to add defense and stability to their portfolios, gold remains a time-tested option. During periods of uncertainty — whether geopolitical, financial, or policy-driven — investors often turn to gold. The precious metal is seen as a store of value, offering protection against inflation, economic downturns and stock market volatility. Even though markets aren’t in crisis mode, gold has been on a remarkable run. Over the past year, it has surged around 40%, recently surpassing $2,800 per ounce. Schiff, a long-time advocate for the yellow metal, believes this is just the beginning. “If gold can go from $20 an ounce to $2,600 an ounce, it can go from $2,600 to $26,000, or even to $100,000. There’s no limit because, again, gold isn’t changing — it’s the value of the dollar that’s decreasing,” he’s predicted. At today’s prices, a move to $100,000 per ounce would represent an astounding upside of over 3,300%. It’s easy to invest in gold these days. Investors can purchase gold bullion, own shares of gold mining companies, invest in gold ETFs and even tap into potential tax advantages through a gold IRA. What to read next

"North Carolina farmer with 1.6 million hens prays for intervention at the front line of America's egg crisis

‘We pray about it every day’: This North Carolina farmer with 1.6 million hens — producing 1.2 million eggs per day — gives unique insight into America’s egg shortage

For nearly four years, avian influenza has ravaged poultry farms across the U.S., forcing farmers to cull entire flocks and sending egg prices soaring.

In Union County, North Carolina, Alex Simpson, president of Simpson’s Eggs, has watched the crisis unfold with growing concern.

“We just can’t get ahead of it no matter what we do,” he told CBS affiliate WBTV. ""We pray about it every day. It's a big fear.""

• None Protect your retirement savings with these 5 essential money moves — most of which you can complete in just minutes

So far, Simpson has avoided an outbreak at his farm, home to 1.6 million hens producing around 1.2 million eggs daily, but not without radical interventions. He and his fellow poultry farmers are on the front line of a costly disease.

Under USDA regulations, if even one bird tests positive for the virus, the entire flock must be slaughtered to prevent further spread. According to Simpson, that policy has led to the loss of nearly 20 million birds nationwide since Jan. 1.

The result? Higher prices and empty store shelves. With millions of hens wiped out, egg prices have jumped 50% in the last year, and experts predict further increases.

In December 2024, a dozen eggs averaged $4.15 — up from $3.45 the previous year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Many grocery stores now limit customers to one or two cartons per visit. Frustrated shoppers have taken to social media to vent their outrage, questioning why such drastic shortages persist nearly four years into the crisis.

“It’s very difficult to keep store shelves full right now,” Simpson admitted.

Read more: Home prices in America could fly through the roof in 2025 — here’s the big reason why and how to take full advantage (with as little as $10)

Restaurants are feeling the pinch. Waffle House recently announced the company's 2,000+ stores will charge an additional .50 per egg due to the shortage.

""The continuing egg shortage caused by HPAI (Bird Flu) has caused a dramatic increase in egg prices,” the company's statement reads. “Consumers and restaurants are being forced to make difficult decisions. Effective February 3, Waffle House has implemented a temporary .50 per egg surcharge to all menus.""

The political stakes are also rising.

With inflation already a hot-button issue, soaring food prices could become a major liability for President Donald Trump. Critics argue that his administration has not done enough to stabilize supply chains and accused him of backtracking on campaign promises.

Meanwhile, his administration has also ordered federal health agencies — including the FDA, CDC and National Institutes of Health — to indefinitely pause communications with the public. That could make it harder for consumers to understand the risks and the spread of bird flu.

It’s not just eggs at stake. The CDC reports that bird flu doesn’t infect humans, but can other animals in the food supply chain, including turkeys and dairy cows.

Farmers fight back, but it might not be enough

For farmers like Simpson, keeping their flocks safe means radically changing how they operate. He used to love inviting people to his farm, including news crews and schoolchildren. But now he says the farm is limited to essential personnel only, in line with USDA recommendations. Other biosecurity measures include:
• None Washing vehicles inside and out before entering farm property.
• None Testing birds regularly, particularly when the chickens indicate symptoms or are moved from one farm to another.

While farmers are doing their part, Simpson says solving the crisis requires more than just individual farm efforts.

""It’s going to take a joint effort from all of animal agriculture, from USDA, from our administration, from Congress, to really just pour resources into this,” he said. “We can’t just keep doing what we’ve been doing.”

Simpson — whose family has been producing eggs in the region for 100 years — went to Washington, D.C. to lobby congressional members and the USDA for additional funding and research to address the crisis across the country.

"Investing.com -- Stardust Power Inc (NASDAQ:SDST) shares continued their upward trajectory, climbing 2.7% in premarket trade Tuesday, following the company's announcement of an exclusive licensing agreement with KMX Technologies. The stock gained 9.3% on Monday.

The agreement, finalized after its initial announcement on October 8, 2024, grants Stardust Power the exclusive rights to utilize KMX's vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) technology for lithium extraction and concentration in the United States, Canada, and select international markets.

This strategic move is aimed at enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of lithium production, a critical component for the burgeoning electric vehicle (EV) and renewable energy sectors.

Stardust Power's CEO, Roshan Pujari, emphasized the importance of the partnership with KMX Technologies, stating that the VMD technology will significantly reduce energy and water use in the company's supply chain.

By concentrating lithium feedstocks, Stardust Power expects to lower operating costs and strengthen the U.S. critical mineral supply chain, thus enhancing national security in an environmentally responsible way.

KMX’s VMD technology not only promises to concentrate lithium from brine sources with minimal losses, thereby improving the economic viability of lithium projects, but it also produces high-quality water as a byproduct.

Stardust Power is an Oklahoma-based company focused on developing battery-grade lithium products.

"A compromised roof can lead to a cascade of damage including water intrusion

RICHBURG, S.C., Feb. 11, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Ahead of spring storms, the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS) urges home and business owners to use its Thunderstorm Ready guides to prepare now to reduce avoidable damage, especially to a structure's roof, which serves as the first line of defense against severe weather. Last year, losses from severe storms alone reached $54 billion, making it the second-highest loss year on record, driven by 17 individual billion-dollar events.

""We turn our science into practical solutions for property owners,"" said Senior Meteorologist Sarah Dillingham.

IBHS researches ways to strengthen buildings against severe weather, and its testing shows when a roof is damaged, that failure can lead to a cascade of damage – including water intrusion – which often results in costly repairs.

""We turn our science into practical solutions for property owners,"" said Senior Meteorologist Sarah Dillingham. ""IBHS research shows for every inch of rain that hits an exposed roof deck, the equivalent of nine bathtubs of water can pour in and cause significant interior damage. Yet, by sealing the seams of your roof deck, you can reduce water intrusion by up to 95%.""

When re-roofing, IBHS recommends property owners ask their contractor to follow its FORTIFIED standard. Based on decades of research, FORTIFIED is a voluntary beyond-code construction and re-roofing method that strengthens buildings against severe weather such as high winds, hurricanes and even tornadoes that often produce damaging hail. In addition to the sealed roof deck required by FORTIFIED, the standard includes a provision for added protection for homes against hail.

Last year, the Storm Prediction Center issued more than 1,800 preliminary tornado local storm reports, the most since 2011. Tornadoes can be very damaging to homes, but hail is often the leading loss-driver, accounting for 50-80% of the damage from severe storms in the U.S. each year.

IBHS's Thunderstorm Ready guides provide actions for property owners of homes and businesses to help reduce the impact of severe storms, better protecting their roofs.
• Check and clear gutters and downspouts to be sure they are secure and free of debris that may restrict water flow.
• Seal gaps and cracks on your building's exterior to prevent water and wind from entering.
• Trim trees with branches overhanging the roof or near windows to avoid damage from high winds.
• Service your garage door and make space in your garage to easily park vehicles when hail is in the forecast and to temporarily place outdoor items like patio furniture and grills during high winds.

Dillingham said IBHS recently launched Roofing Roadmaps, a one-stop resource for property owners to learn more about roofs. Roof 101 is the first in the new Roofing Roadmaps series, exploring each roof cover and its wind and hail test standards.

""Homeowners should know as much about their roofs as they do their kitchen floors, cabinets and countertops,"" Dillingham said. ""IBHS is making that easier with this new resource that levels the information playing field and will eventually include guidance on the best and worst performing roof cover materials for wind and hail.""

For more ways to prepare your property to prevent damage from severe storms, IBHS's full residential and commercial Thunderstorm Ready guides, along with easy-to-follow downloadable checklists, are available on ibhs.org.

"Russian troops struck controlled aviation bombs on Zolochevskaya Gromad in the Kharkov region, as a result of which seven people were injured. The shelling occurred around 11:27.



This was reported by the head of the Kharkov regional military administration Oleg Sinegubov, reports Hurray Inform. 



One of the ammunition was struck by a private residential building. Initially, four wounded, including a 12-year-old boy, was reported. However, later the number of victims increased to six, and then to seven. Sinegubov specified that the three wounded were hospitalized, the rest of the assistance was provided on the spot. 



The Ministry of the Interior of Ukraine added that the blow led to significant destruction. Two private houses were completely destroyed, 11 households, outbuildings were damaged, and the hits of Svetlichnaya, Berezovka, Makarich and Oreshansky forest were recorded in the vicinity. Emergency services work on the places of incidents. 



“Terrorists continue to use aviation bombs for hijacked infrastructure, which leads to tragic consequences. We do our best to quickly eliminate the consequences of attacks, ”said the representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

"When navigating the complexities of modern life, everyone has their own methods for finding balance. For some, engaging in physical activities like jogging or yoga brings a sense of relief, while others may turn to creative things like painting or writing. There are also those who find comfort in being alone, watching shows, or simply enjoying movies. The type of content that brings comfort can vary widely. Some people might lean towards a gripping mystery, while others might seek out a light-hearted comedy. Take Subhash, for instance, from Uttar Pradesh; when he’s feeling sad, he craves something uplifting that offers a break from reality.

For many young people, especially those from Generation Z like Suhani, Samay Raina, the popular Kashmiri stand-up comedian, serves as a source of joy and distraction.

For Priya, Samay’s humor helps lift her spirits when she’s feeling low. On the other hand, an architect from Uttrakhand, prefers to listen to Arijit Singh’s music during her sad moments, but she also enjoys watching Samay and his show, “India’s Got Latent,” while having meals or hanging out with friends.

Samay Raina’s journey in the entertainment industry, especially with his spin-off reality show, reflects a significant shift in how young audiences engage with content. His ability to infuse dark comedy into a format like “India’s Got Latent” taps into the preferences of young Indians who appreciate humor that reflects the complexities of life.

The fact that both “India’s Got Talent” and “India’s Got Latent” share the same IMDb rating of 5.4 suggests that while they might be similar in perception, Samay’s unique approach to reality television sets his show apart. By branding it as ‘unscripted, unfiltered, and raw,’ he appeals to a generation that values authenticity over the often-criticized scripted nature of many reality shows.

Vicky’s experience highlights how Samay’s style resonates with viewers on a personal level. His transition from being perceived as ‘annoying’ to becoming a ‘comfort space’ exemplifies how humor and relatability can create a strong connection with audiences. Samay’s casual, friendly manner of speaking makes his content feel like a conversation among friends, which is essential for young viewers seeking genuine interactions in the content they consume.

What is the reason behind this?

When we asked several young subscribers of India’s Got Latent about what makes Samay and his comedic style so appealing, the word ‘relatable’ came up the most. As Vicky pointed out, Samay interacts with everyone, including celebrities and contestants, as if they are friends, which enhances his relatability.

“I appreciate Samay for his distinctive sense of humor and relatable content that resonates with many. His timing is excellent, and his ability to tackle social issues in a light-hearted manner is impressive,” Twinkle shares.

“Samay’s comedic style is like a breath of fresh air! He has this uncanny ability to turn mundane situations into laugh-out-loud moments, which totally resonates with us,” says Rupa.

“What makes Samay stand out is his fearless approach to comedy. He dives into tricky topics with a light-hearted touch, making it relatable and fun,” remarks Naina.

So, how did he and his show become so relatable and attract such a large online following in a short time? The answer lies in dark humor.

Dark humor and roasts aren’t new in India. All India Bakchod (AIB) was famous for a similar style, though we all remember how that turned out. However, it appears that audiences are now embracing this format once again (times have indeed changed).

Experts were consulted to understand the sudden fascination with ‘dark humor.’

Although Samay stated in a recent podcast with Prakhar Gupta that he wouldn’t define himself strictly as a dark humor comedian—known for grim or satirical content—his fans and the internet often label him as such due to his viral clips.

Sangita, a mental health expert, points out that his relatability comes from his comedic style, which is notably quick, sharp, and witty, particularly in live, improvisational settings. She highlights his talent for flipping situations and delivering clever responses that make audiences laugh. For many, this quick humor is both impressive and something to aspire to. Observing someone handle banter so effortlessly can be both entertaining and inspiring, fostering a sense of connection.

“Comedy, especially dark comedy, has long been an effective means of connecting with others and providing relief. It can make difficult subjects easier to discuss and allow people to face their fears. In the safe space of a comedy show, audiences often feel comfortable laughing at topics they might avoid in other situations,” she explains.

Sangita further explains that Samay’s show offers more creative freedom compared to traditional, heavily curated television comedies like The Great Indian Laughter Challenge.

“Platforms like YouTube allow for more experimentation and risk-taking, which Samay has effectively utilized,” she notes.

Another health expert, and a paid member of Samay’s India’s Got Latent, shares that audiences find him relatable due to his self-presentation.

“I watched his podcast with Prakhar and realized that Samay faced a lot of bullying as a child. That explains a lot about his character and behavior,” she mentions.

Dipra points out that if you look closely, it’s Samay’s journey that resonates with people—a young boy who faced bullying and has now transformed his life, achieving dreams not just for himself but also for his parents.

Another counseling psychologist observes that roast culture and dark humor have become more popular recently, partly because they address frustrations and societal stereotypes that many people keep hidden. By presenting these issues in a relatable manner, such humor strikes a chord with audiences.

Another reason audiences and experts find Samay more likable is his ability to joke about himself.

However, the dark side of dark humor exists. Shows like India’s Got Latent aren’t for everyone, and it’s easy for some people to take offense.

“Disrespecting people with disabilities is not dark humor,” says Tanisha who previously called out Samay Raina for a joke made when one of the contestants mocked people with disabilities, with everyone—including the judges—laughing.

“If I’m making fun of myself and my insecurities, that’s okay. Someone who is not disabled and has privilege can’t disrespect people and our community, especially now when we’ve worked so hard to raise awareness and sensitivity,” she explains.

For others, the issue also lies in the crass language used in such humor.

Here are two examples that garnered significant attention:

The first controversy involves Samay Raina and Kusha Kapila, which emerged from a roast segment on the show ‘Pretty Good Roast’ last year. During this segment, Raina made jokes about Kapila’s recent divorce from Zorawar Ahluwalia, which she found to be ‘dehumanising.’ This led to a lot of backlash directed at both comedians. After the episode aired, Kusha blocked Samay on Instagram, signaling that there was still tension between them. Kusha later shared that she didn’t approve of the jokes before the show and only participated as a way to show strength, although she ended up regretting it. Their friendship has taken a hit, with Samay admitting that it will take time for them to move on and find humor in the situation again.

In another incident, Samay faced criticism when a contestant on his show, India’s Got Latent, made a joke about Deepika Padukone’s struggles with depression in November 2024. This joke caused outrage among viewers and mental health advocates, prompting Raina to publicly respond to the backlash. True to his style, he posted a story saying, “To everyone who is outraging on Twitter, one request: Could you please outrage in my YouTube comment section so I get some ad revenue from the traction, at least.”

The distinction between what is considered problematic and what is not can be quite ambiguous. It’s a fine line, often difficult to define, and even experts find it challenging.

Despite Samay’s supporters arguing that dark humor should be taken lightly, he and his show have faced criticism for crossing boundaries.

Conversely, one Gen Z points out that while some individuals find comfort in dark humor, particularly as a coping mechanism for mental health issues, others may feel offended. For viewers, dark comedy can provide a voyeuristic thrill, as it challenges societal norms that many would hesitate to confront themselves. He concludes that this dual nature is fundamental to the genre—what may be uplifting and freeing for one person can come across as hurtful or thoughtless to someone else.",2025-02-11T12:22:32+00:00,https://www.mypunepulse.com/the-secret-to-samay-rainas-popularity-what-makes-him-a-gen-z-favorite-in-india/,8c47e028a1054a7da1e729010ef5d0df
"After recurring coffee price rise, manufacturers began to produce a product that was more affordable. Fake coffee, or cafake, as it was nicknamed on social networks, is sold as “traditional coffee drink”, and does not have the seed of coffee, which is the raw material of ordinary coffee. According to the Brazilian Coffee Industry Association (ABIC), the product is not recorded by the National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) to be marketed.

Fake coffee is produced by aromatizing powder produced from peels, leaves, straw, sticks and other parts of the plant, and has become popular on social networks in recent days for its low cost compared to ordinary coffee. In images released on social networks, Cafake powder is marketed for $ 13.99, alongside traditional coffee, which has approximately $ 30. The product in question is from the company Master Blends, which states that it produced the byproduct making it clear in packaging the differentiation of the product to its traditional in question.

The theme of “fakes” foods remembered the controversial condensed milk, which is marketed as “dairy mix”, and raised discussion on social networks about the similarity of product packaging with their traditional versions, which commonly leads the customer to choose the product Cheaper by mistake, not knowing that it is buying a product of inferior quality.

Due to the uncertainty of its quality, the cafake may present risks to the health of the population, increasing the risk of allergies and consumption of toxic substances, as well as the absence of the benefits that coffee presents to its consumer. The Brazilian Coffee Industry Association (ABIC) reported that the case of Master Blends has already been reported to the Ministry of Agriculture and the National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa), in concern for consumer health and the market issue.

Because of the similarity of the packaging, so that they do not make the wrong purchase consumers need to be aware of the existence of poor quality coffee, and also be aware of the trips to the supermarket, reading the product labels carefully before purchase.",2025-02-10T18:29:59+00:00,https://tribunadonorte.com.br/natal/cafake-entenda-subproduto-do-cafe-que-e-vendido-a-baixo-custo/,eb49837772e548d1825e1222c685f8d9

"NAMASTE: Not the greeting, but a government effort to help sanitation workers

India's NAMASTE scheme, launched in 2023, aims to improve the lives of sanitation workers. The initiative provides financial assistance, safety training, and skill development to create safer and more dignified working conditions.

New Delhi: Sanitation workers have always risked their lives for their livelihood in India and worked in perilous conditions. In recent years, the Indian government introduced mass sanitation drives like the Swachh Bharat Mission due to which more than 18 crore toilets have been built in the country. It resulted in a a huge demand for skilled sanitation workers, people who are treated as marginalized despite their selfless contributions to maintaining the health and hygiene of our society. For their benefit, the government has introduced the NAMASTE scheme.

What is the NAMASTE scheme?

In 2023-24, the Indian government launched the National Action for Mechanised Sanitation Ecosystem or NAMASTE scheme with the aim to provide dignity to sanitation workers and to empower them economically and socially. The National Safai Karmacharis Finance Development Corporation (NSKFDC) under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MoSJE) is implementing NAMASTE. It is being implemented for three years from FY 2023-24 to FY 2025-26, with a budget of Rs 349.73 crores.

What are the objective of the NAMASTE scheme?
• The NAMASTE scheme aims to ensure safety and dignity of sanitation workers. It aims to do so by creating an ecosystem which will honour sanitation workers and their key role in maintaining sanitation infrastructure in the country. The workers have to be provided with a sustainable livelihood and their occupational safety should be increased with greater access to safety gear and machines.
• The objective of the scheme is to provide livelihoods support so that the sanitation workers are not vulnerable and they can get access to self-employment by providing capital subsidy for Sanitation Related Project. Also, it strives to generate skilled wage employment opportunities for them after the workers get safety training and PPE kits.
• Moreover, the scheme aims to change the perspective of citizens towards sanitation workers and result in an increased demand for safe sanitation services.

The intended outcome of the NAMASTE scheme

The intended outcomes of the NAMASTE scheme include zero fatalities in sanitation work, and formalization and skilling of sanitation workers. Also, its goal is to eliminate direct contact with human faecal matter, increase the power of Emergency Response Sanitation Units (ERSUs), empower sanitation workers through self-help groups and entrepreneurship and provide them with alternate options of livelihood, and give occupational safety training to all sewer and septic tank workers (SSWs).

The scheme also includes Waste Pickers engaged in Solid Waste Management to provide them safe, dignified and sustainable livelihoods. Waste pickers will be enumerated and provided training on occupational safety and skill upgradation training. Thanks to the NAMASTE scheme, sanitation workers who have been ignored for a long time in India are finding their feet and ways to come out of the occupation and find alternate ways of livelihood, giving them a much better and risk-free life.",2025-02-11T12:03:34+00:00,https://www.news9live.com/knowledge/namaste-not-the-greeting-but-a-government-effort-to-help-sanitation-workers-2818855,97d2932a0d2043148867440584f12168
"National Institutes of Health (NIH) scientists and their colleagues report that a single dose of a broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) administered prior to virus exposure protects macaques from severe H5N1 avian influenza. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses have sporadically spilled over from birds into many other animals, including humans and dairy cows, in recent years. Although it has not yet acquired the capacity to spread readily between people, H5N1 has pandemic potential, which has spurred efforts to develop effective treatments and other countermeasures.

The investigators studied a bnAb called MEDI8852, which was discovered and developed by Medimmune, now part of AstraZeneca. MEDI8852 targets a portion of a key flu protein that is less prone to change than other parts of the virus and thus is capable of conferring protection against a wide range of flu viruses. In the new study, a group of macaques received an injection of MEDI8852 and were exposed to aerosolized HPAI H5N1 virus three days later. All the pre-treated animals survived and experienced no or very limited signs of disease. In contrast, a group of control macaques developed severe or fatal illness within a short time after virus exposure. Of note, the scientists determined that MEDI8852 remained in the body for a prolonged time after the injection. According to scientists, protection from severe disease would extend to weeks beyond antibody infusion, providing a realistic preventative window in the face of an H5N1 outbreak.

The research was conducted by Masaru Kanekiyo, D.V.M, Ph.D., and colleagues from NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center (VRC) along with investigators from the University of Pittsburgh. It was published in Science.

Dr. Kanekiyo, VRC, NIAID, is available to comment.

"The crypto market adopts sustainable, utility-driven projects as its main focus because meme tokens demonstrate only fleeting popularity. RXS and THORChain (RUNE) are front-runners in providing investors with ecosystems based on real-world value creation. Rexas Finance distinguishes itself from other platforms by enabling investors to tokenize real estate properties and precious metals and THORChain distinguishes itself by providing cross-chain liquidity solutions for native blockchain tokens. The continuous development of security protocols and new features from RXS and RUNE has led to increasing interest in their tokens as long-term investment opportunities.

Meme coins have less appeal among the traders and more traders are opting for Rexas Finance (RXS). Investors favor stable projects offering real-world asset tokenization over highly volatile assets. As a secure ecosystem with cutting-edge features, Rexas Finance is being noticed for sustainable growth opportunities.

Rexas Finance enables physical non-fungible-based collateral and derivatives in the form of physical assets such as real estate and precious metals, with the option of fractional ownership for investors thereby increasing liquidity to high-value investments.

The Impressive Presale Performance Proves Value to the Investors

In addition, growing investor confidence is also shown in the RXS token price rise of over 500% in the Project’s presale. The total figure raised is around $44.6 million, which confirms the enthusiasm for the platform’s utility services. Rexas Finance does not use venture capital and follows a path of community first, where early involvement is based on the public.

Rexas Finance went through an extensive audit with blockchain security firm CertiK and secured a prime position for security. Identifying potential vulnerabilities, the audit improves transparency and thus increases investor confidence. In addition, user engagement is important for Rexas Finance, and as such, the project has come up with a $1 million giveaway to encourage user participation and engagement.

The services that are offered by Rexas Finance’s platform include stalking, decentralized finance (DeFi) trading, and non-fungible token (NFT) minting. The tokenomics structure also supports long-term sustainability with staking reward and liquidity allocation. By following this approach, the trading becomes smooth and appeals to retail and institutional investors. The increased liquidity and visibility of RXS should be expected when RXS lists on major exchanges in the future. Then, higher liquidity may increase the trading volume, leading to a growing demand, thus allowing it to have an impact on the token’s price growth. According to analysts, these developments could find their crest in 2025 resulting in high price appreciations.

RUNE is the native token of THORChain and is critical for the protocol’s cross-chain liquidity and asset swapping. RUNE serves as the primary asset in all the liquidity pools and makes it possible to swap native assets directly across different blockchains without being wrapped. RUNE pool bonding one of the key functions of RUNE is to set a 1:1 collateral ratio with the total value of assets added as liquidity on the pool. This way, the protocol’s risks and rewards go to those who hold RUNE or provide liquidity. Moreover, RUNE additionally grants liquidity providers compensation for impermanent loss which is when the value of the given liquidity provider’s contributed assets fluctuates due to a price shift. THORChain is dependent on security and decentralization, and RUNE is an integral part to this by allowing transactions to be validated and helping to keep the network stable. To stake large amounts of RUNE to secure the network and process cross-chain transactions, a process known as nodes (validators).

"DeFi has grown, but trading still feels like a mess. Markets have expanded into real-world assets (RWAs), perpetual futures, and FX, but the actual experience of trading across these assets is full of friction. Traders deal with fragmented liquidity, collateral stuck in staking contracts, and a system that still revolves around USD stablecoins.

is fixing this by launching an Integrated DEX with LST & Perp Futures for FX RWAs. By combining liquid staking RWAs with a Perpetual Futures DEX, Cables enables assets like cEUR, cJPY, and cXAU to function as both collateral and tradable instruments, eliminating the inefficiencies of fragmented liquidity. Instead of forcing participants to move liquidity across different protocols, Cables connects yield, collateral, and trade execution in a single system—powering the Cables Liquidity Flywheel. This self-reinforcing cycle allows the Cables Community to deposit anything, earn yield on anything, and trade or leverage it without friction. Cables recently and , outlining how it will seamlessly integrate RWAs into DeFi 2.0. With a focus on building for the Cables Community—not just users—this next evolution of DeFi puts accessibility, liquidity, and global adoption at the forefront.

For all its advancements, DeFi still feels outdated. Traders looking to hedge non-USD currencies, earn yield on real-world assets, or trade multiple markets often end up bouncing between different platforms, waiting on bridges, and converting back to USD just to execute trades. Liquidity is scattered across different chains, making it harder to enter and exit positions efficiently. Assets that should be usable in trading are locked in staking contracts, leaving traders to choose between earning passive yield or keeping capital available. And for those looking to trade outside the USD-dominated system, choices are limited—most DeFi pairs still revolve around USDT or USDC, forcing FX traders into unnecessary conversions. DeFi shouldn’t just be about adding more assets. It should be about making them usable in real markets. That’s where Cables’ launch of its Integrated LST & Perpetual Futures for FX RWAs in one DEX will dominate and show the world what DeFi 2.0 truly means.

Cables Finance is solving this by making liquid staking RWAs a core piece of trading infrastructure. With liquid staking, the Cables Community doesn’t have to choose between earning yield and accessing deep, liquid markets. Assets like cEUR, cJPY, and cXAU remain liquid, earning yield while serving as active collateral on the Cables Perp DEX. A trader looking to hedge euro exposure can hold cEUR, collect yield, and use it for leveraged positions at the same time. A gold-backed stable asset like cXAU provides access to a decentralized gold market while acting as collateral. Instead of unstaking funds or swapping between isolated liquidity pools, the Cables Community can trade, hedge, and earn in one place. This approach removes unnecessary steps from DeFi trading. Instead of shifting liquidity between staking and active markets, capital can move freely within a single system.

The future of DeFi isn’t just about adding assets—it’s about making them work for traders. Liquid staking RWAs allow traders to keep assets active while earning yield, removing the trade-offs that exist today. Cables Finance combines deep liquidity with perpetual futures, creating a trading system where RWAs aren’t just passive holdings—they’re part of an active, high-volume market. Instead of treating RWAs as an afterthought, Cables puts them at the core of DeFi 2.0 trading. DeFi has spent years making assets tradable. Now, Cables Finance is making trading better—with a Liquidity Flywheel that connects deposit, yield, and leverage in one system. DeFi 2.0 is here. The Cables Community is building it.",2025-02-11T12:20:19+00:00,https://www.analyticsinsight.net/cryptocurrency-analytics-insight/defi-20-cables-finance-is-building-an-integrated-dex-with-lst-perpetual-futures-trading-for-fx-rwas,9f144b21d8e44594bce080e4d42a5c8e
"The Sussex Police Federation is raising concerns over the prosecution of a former officer for dangerous driving in Bognor during the apprehension of two convicted criminals escaping on an e-bike.

On Friday, PC Tim Bradshaw was found not guilty of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and driving without due care and attention.

This followed an incident in November 2022 where he ""nudged"" the back wheel of an e-bike with his police vehicle.

Sussex Police Federation’s Deputy Chair, Andy Newman, supported him through the case, and read a statement outside Portsmouth Crown Court, saying: “Police officers like Tim are out protecting communities 365 days a year, making sure that you are safe.”

The incident took place in November 2022 in Bognor Regis, when Mr Bradshaw touched the back wheel of an e-bike with his marked police car, causing the rider, Mason McGarry, and pillion passenger Dominic Mizzi, to lose control and fall to the ground.

Mr McGarry suffered a broken tibia and required surgery. The court heard that Mr McGarry had more than 40 convictions, including for robbery, theft and dangerous driving. Mr Mizzi also told the court that he had numerous convictions, including for assaulting emergency workers.

Mr Bradshaw said he had “nudged” the e-bike with the bumper of his car and added: “It was light contact”. He said he believed it was “a justified, necessary action”, and the court agreed, finding him not guilty of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. He was also cleared of causing serious injury by driving without due care and attention.

Speaking outside court, the Federation’s Andy Newman said: “Today a jury has taken 20 minutes to come to a not guilty verdict and clear the name of retired PC Tim Bradshaw.

“This case demonstrates that police officers only have seconds to make decisions to uphold the law. Tim hopes that, moving forward, police organisations will show the courage and confidence that this jury has shown in supporting and protecting communities.

“Police officers like Tim are out protecting communities 365 days a year making sure that you are safe. Tim would like to thank his legal team, Counsel Mark Aldred and MJR solicitors, as well as Sussex Police Federation. He has also thanked his family for supporting him through the two years and three months it has taken to come to court.”",2025-02-11T11:55:53+00:00,https://www.v2radio.co.uk/news/west-sussex/the-sussex-police-federation-question-pcs-prosecution/,22206b48af3241b880e779d42915468d
"Praise be as it seems Holly and Alex are officially over after MAFS UK as she posted pictures of herself and her rumoured new boyfriend, who’s also a reality TV star.

Holly posted pictures of herself with Mike Durrant as they posed hand in hand together, as well as another picture where her hand is on her thigh. It all looks very romantic.

Whilst the pair haven’t confirmed they’re in a romantic relationship together, their captions certainly seemed to hint that they’re more than just friends, with him writing: “Organising divorces.”

But whilst MAFS UK made Holly into a reality TV star, it seems Mike is no stranger to the cameras either, as he appeared on Dating Naked UK last year.

And yes, that show is exactly what it sounds like where everyone was fully stark naked and competing against each other for a £50,000 prize.

Before he appeared on the show he dated Chloe Ferry but whilst on the show started a romance with Tiarne Butler. However, Tiarne was voted off the reality show and later revealed she and Mike had decided to split up.

She confessed that she’d decided to take a “massive risk” and moved to Spain in order to be with Mike, but claimed she was “sold a dream of who he was.” Yikes!

Still, it seems like everything is going well between Holly and Mike so far and honestly, I’m just happy she’s not with Alex from MAFS UK anymore.

I genuinely didn’t know what was happening with those two after the show, and despite them both continually insisting they weren’t together it always seemed like they were. So hopefully that chapter can now finally be closed.

"We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Warren Buffett Dividend Stocks To Invest In Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stands against the other dividend stocks.

Warren Buffett is a widely recognized name in the investment world, known for his influence and expertise. His strategies are closely followed by many aspiring investors, reflecting the high regard in which he is held. What sets Buffett apart is his steadfast commitment to the investment principles that have guided him throughout his career, with a strong focus on value investing. In addition to value strategy, Buffett is also inclined toward dividend stocks.

Dividend stocks have long been a cornerstone of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio, accounting for over 90% of its holdings. Buffett’s preference for dividend-paying stocks has frequently been discussed in the media, especially given that Berkshire itself does not distribute dividends. He is recognized for his disciplined approach, focusing on acquiring stocks with the intention of holding them for extended periods—often spanning years or even decades. This long-term outlook enables him to take advantage of compounding returns while staying resilient through market fluctuations. His strategy has delivered strong results, with the portfolio overseen by Buffett and his team expected to generate approximately $6 billion in annual dividend income. Notably, just seven companies are anticipated to generate $4.5 billion in annual dividends for his company.

Buffett's commitment to holding stocks for the long term is often seen as a crucial element of his investment success. Peter Kunhardt, a director of the HBO documentary “Becoming Warren Buffett”, made the following comment in his 2017 interview:

Buffett’s dividend investing strategy isn’t centered on chasing the highest yields. Instead, he focuses on finding strong, well-managed companies that can sustain and grow their dividends over time. He favors steady, reliable businesses with moderate yields over riskier stocks with higher payouts. Given Buffett’s track record, it’s clear that his approach is well-founded, as dividend stocks have played a crucial role in overall market returns. Between 1993 and the end of 2022, the broader market rose by 777%, but when dividends were included, the total return exceeded 1,400%. This highlights the significant contribution of dividends, accounting for more than 20% of the market’s overall gains during that period.

Examining the performance of dividend stocks over earlier periods reveals that they have played a substantial role in overall market returns. Dividends have historically been a major contributor to the total returns of US stocks, making up nearly one-third of overall equity gains since 1926. From 1980 to 2019, a period characterized by declining interest rates, dividends accounted for 75% of the broader market’s returns. In such environments, dividends become even more valuable, providing consistent income when bond yields are lower. Companies that start paying dividends tend to maintain them and often increase their payouts over time. In addition, issuing dividends can make a stock more attractive to investors, potentially driving up its market value. By the close of Q3 2024, most companies in Buffett’s portfolio had a strong track record of paying dividends and steadily increasing them over time. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks in Warren Buffett’s portfolio. For this article, we analyzed Berkshire Hathaway’s 13F portfolio as of the third quarter of 2024 and identified dividend stocks. From that group, we picked 13 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, tracked by Insider Money as of Q3 2024. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge funds having stakes in them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Is Visa Inc. (V) the Best Wide Moat Stocks to Invest In? A close-up of a modern payments terminal with a pile of credit cards on the side. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is an American multinational payment card service company that offers a wide range of related services and products to its consumers. While discussions continue about the possible challenges posed by fintech and alternative payment methods, Visa's competitive advantage has only grown stronger over time. The company benefits from its extensive scale and an inflation-resistant business model. Its track record highlights its strong business fundamentals, having achieved a total return CAGR of 21.6% since going public in 2008. In the past 12 months, the stock has surged by nearly 28%. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) showed strong earnings in fiscal Q1 2025. The company posted revenue of $9.5 billion, representing a 10% increase from the prior year. During the quarter ending December 31, 2024, the company handled 63.8 billion transactions, up 11% year-over-year. In addition, payment volume grew by 9% on a constant-dollar basis compared to the same period last year. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) maintained a solid cash position, closing the quarter with more than $16 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Operating cash flow rose to $5.4 billion, an increase from $3.6 billion in the same period last year. The company also distributed $5.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. It is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as the company has been raising its payouts for 16 years straight. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.67%, as of February 10. Overall V ranks 1st on our list of the best dividend stocks according to Warren Buffett. While we acknowledge the potential for V as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

"(Reuters) - Binance and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have jointly asked a court for a 60-day stay on the regulator's lawsuit against the crypto exchange, citing the potential impact of a newly launched task force.

In a court filing dated Monday, the parties said the task force, formed last month to work on crypto regulations, may ""impact and facilitate the potential resolution of this case"".

The stay could be an early sign of the SEC's pivot to a more crypto-friendly stance, reflecting President Donald Trump's pledge to make the U.S. a global hub for the industry.

In contrast, former SEC Chair Gary Gensler had termed the industry ""the Wild West"". Under him, the regulator sued Binance in June 2023, accusing the company and its former CEO Changpeng Zhao of artificially inflating trading volumes, diverting customer funds and misleading investors about its market surveillance controls.

Last year, a federal judge ruled that the majority of the lawsuit could proceed. The regulator is also locked in a dispute with another crypto exchange Coinbase.

""The Commission's handling of crypto has been marked by legal imprecision and commercial impracticality... It took us a long time to get into this mess, and it is going to take us some time to get out of it,"" SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who is leading the task force, said in a statement earlier this month.

Trump picked crypto-friendly Washington lawyer Paul Atkins as the new chair of the SEC, while prominent Republicans have ramped up efforts to curb what some have called ""Operation Chokepoint 2.0"" - the alleged denial of financial services to crypto companies.",2025-02-11T12:15:28+00:00,https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/binance-sec-request-pause-legal-121528117.html,3cad8834722b4e7eb1442b1a40631707
"Feral pigs have become the latest “illegal release” in the Scottish Highlands, weeks after four lynx were captured following their illegal release in the same area.

The Cairngorms National Park Authority said that its staff were trying to round up about 20 of the “relatively domesticated” animals last seen near the Uath Lochans area.

A spokesman for the park said: “We are aware that feral pigs have been spotted in an area of the Cairngorms National Park near Uath Lochans.

“The Park Authority is working closely with partners – including NatureScot and Forestry and Land Scotland (FLS) – to ascertain the full facts on the ground and Forestry and Land Scotland is currently attempting to trap the animals.

“The animals appear to be relatively domesticated and it is likely that this is an illegal release.

“The park authority condemns any illegal release of animals in the strongest possible terms.”

Scottish Land and Estates (SLE), which supports rural businesses, condemned the “reckless” release, and encouraged anyone with information to contact police.

Ross Ewing, the director of moorland at SLE, said: “This appears to be a reckless and illegal act which demonstrates a total disregard for both animal welfare and the wider environment.

“We saw the tragic consequences of last month’s illegal lynx release, which resulted in the death of one of the animals.

“Those responsible for these incidents show little concern for the welfare of the species they release or the serious impacts they could have.

“Anyone with information about this incident should contact Police Scotland by calling 101.”

It comes after four lynx were released into the park last month, one of which died shortly after they were captured.

Their dumping was initially thought to have been part of a rewilding scheme, although experts suggested it was more likely abandonment from their owner with the intention they would be rescued.

While environment activists who support reintroduction of the once native species to the UK were widely blamed, it was subsequently suggested that the animals may have been unwanted pets.

This was because the elusive animals were easily recaptured by keepers using food in traps, appeared to be familiar with humans and had been left with straw bedding and dead chicks.

A NatureScot spokesman said: “We are aware of a number of sightings of feral pigs in the Insh area.

“FLS are leading on trapping these animals and we are liaising with partner agencies to ascertain the full circumstances of how they came to be in the area.

“We understand that Police Scotland has also been informed of the situation.”

Police Scotland said that it was not involved at this time.",2025-02-11T12:15:49+00:00,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/feral-pigs-become-latest-illegal-121549424.html,123908cbfaab4ea680cefba9232d3e6e
"Pret A Manger has dropped a planned doubling of its current £5 monthly subscription for up to five coffees a day, it has announced.

The sandwich chain has written to subscribers to tell them its Club Pret monthly subscription fee will remain at £5, saying: “At Pret, we believe in offering high-quality, organic coffee and Barista-made drinks at fantastic value.

“With Club Pret, you’ll continue to enjoy great savings on up to five Barista-made drinks per day.”

Pret had previously told subscribers that their subscription would increase to £10 a month from March 31, when a “50% off” deal ended.

It followed Pret overhauling its £360-a-year subscription in July last year in favour of 50% off up to five coffees a day for £10 a month.

The chain also removed a 20% discount on food for subscribers to end dual pricing – “something we never really got comfortable with”, it said at the time.

Under the old deal that lasted for almost four years, Club Pret membership offered up to five barista-made drinks daily for a monthly fee of £30.

In March last year, the chain implemented a crackdown to prevent Club Pret subscribers from sharing free drinks with others.

Some customers were exploiting loopholes by sharing subscription benefits, prompting the changes.

The announcement followed coffee bean prices reaching an all-time high of 4,300 US dollars (£3,356) a tonne last week, amid poor harvests, particularly in the major production areas of Brazil and Vietnam, geopolitical conflict and supply chain disruption.

But prices have continued to soar to record highs amid concerns about low stocks in Brazil, which supplies almost half of the world’s Arabica, the beans favoured by coffee shop chains.",2025-02-11T12:16:13+00:00,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/pret-manger-drops-doubling-5-121613760.html,f8333afc9b3f4ba98579735b3f96e945
"Creative differences may have played a part in one AEW star’s exit from the company as it seemed he did not want to lose any matches.

Tony Khan has wielded the axe on the AEW roster as three wantaway stars have finally been given their release from the company. Malakai Black’s contract has been allowed to expire bringing an end to his tumultuous time in the company.

Miro and Ricky Starks have been released by the company with neither man being seen in the company for a long time. But questions have been raised over the timing of these exits as well as what it means for Rey Fenix who has also made clear that he wants to leave.

Speaking about the situation on Wrestling Observer Radio, Dave Meltzer gave more insight into the releases and noted creative differences hampered at least one star’s AEW career as they did not want to lose:

Malakai Black, I think his contract expired. Ricky Starks and Miro were both released. Obviously they hadn’t been using any of the 3 for a variety of reasons. Largely because they were leaving and you know, if someone’s gonna leave, Tony’s not gonna use them. But he was paying them and I guess the idea is – I didn’t get any reason why this happened now compared to months ago because he hasn’t used these guys in forever. Miro hasn’t been used since 2023, and he was hurt before that. He was hurt, when he came back they had creative differences and they just didn’t use him…He didn’t wanna lose. Ricky, inevitably he’s going to WWE and they figured if you’re gonna go, we’re not going to use you.

Questions had been asked over the status of Rey Fenix who seems to be on his way out of the company as well. Fenix’s brother Penta has joined WWE and Fenix has made clear he intends to join him. Tony Khan has added time to Fenix’s AEW deal, however, due to time missed and it seems he’s still part of Khan’s company for now:

Meltzer went on to note that he is certain Malakai Black and Ricky Starks are heading to WWE and while not certain, he expects Miro to do the same.

"The upward trajectory within the New York arabica contract, continued a positive track to start the week yesterday. The latest round of forecasts to be released for the upcoming Brazil coffee crop to come in 2025/26 coffee year, projected at 64.10 million bags, according to Hedgepoint Global Markets. Their estimate for arabica coffee put at 41.10 million bags, and Conilon robustaa crop put at an estimated 23 million bags. The review indicates that their Brazil 2025/26 production forecast, with Brazil Conilon areas a couple of months away from harvest, is 1.70% lower overall than their earlier, November 2024 assessment.

Following the Tet Lunar New Year celebrations, Vietnam producers have returned to regular trade although actively is generally, muted.

The Certified washed Arabica coffee stocks held against the New York exchange were seen to increase by 10,253 bags yesterday, to register these stocks at 872,991 bags, with 97.65% of these certified stocks held in Europe, at a total of 852,515 bags and the remaining 2.35% being held in the USA at a total 20,476 Bags. Of this, a total 558,823 bags or 64.01% of the coffees registered and stored in consumer country certified warehouses of the exchange, are Brazil washed arabica, and a further 10.45% of these certified coffees, from Peru. The pending grading stocks posted a increase of 2,169 bags on the day, to register 130,076 bags pending grading on the day.

The March 2025 to March 2025 contract arbitrage between the London and New York markets widened yesterday, to register this at 171.82 Usc/Lb. This equates to 40.04% price discount for the London robusta coffee. The widening arbitrage is likely to attract greater interest in robusta coffee for price sensitive blends.

It was a firmer day on the commodity markets yesterday. The steady flow of trade policy pivots emanating from largest consumer economy, USA., together with geopolitical uncertainty has led to safe haven Gold markets rally, and the US Federal Reserve Bank statements anticipated later this week. It was a firmer day for Coffee, Gold, Silver, Platinum, Palladium, Corn and Sugar markets, while a softer close for Cocoa, Soybean and Wheat. The day starts with the U.S. Dollar trading at 1.236 Sterling, at 1.031 the Euro and with the US Dollar buying 5.787 Brazil Real.

The New York and London markets started the day trading in firmer territory, carrying through the momentum from the close on Friday. The markets moved in limited early day volume and gained support with limited selling activity to cap the early gains. The New York market set a thirteenth consecutive positive traction and continued to build momentum throughout the session. The latter-day volume increased to post a hefty 69,251 Lots traded between the prompt month and the next, as first notice day approaches next week. The London market traced a higher day, in comparatively more deliberate motion, versus the wild chart breaking upward trajectory in New York as weather reports indicated a drier than usual week ahead for Brazil. A strengthening Brazil Real against the US Dollar discourages seller activity, while technical activity and speculative sentiment across the commodities basket appear to be attracting fresh speculative participation. As the afternoon progressed the markets continued to register buy stop action. London followed suit to register significant gains throughout the afternoon session. The New York market continued upward momentum, before being capped very late in the day, to see the market marginally drop back and settle on a very firm note at the close. The London market settled on a firm note at the close, with most of the earlier gains of the day intact.

The London market ended the day on a positive note with 79.14% of the earlier gains of the day intact, while the New York market ended the day on a likewise very positive note, with 89.49% of the earlier gains of the day intact. The InterContinental Exchange announced an increase in initial margin rates following the close yesterday, for all arabica coffee futures contracts, to possibly see the markets set for a follow through steady start to early trade today, against the prices set yesterday, as follows:

"Perceiving whether another person is a personal health risk requires quickly assessing their trustworthiness. With limited characteristics available, implicit assumptions often influence risk perception. Research in this area has pointed to brain regions that may be involved in perceiving others as untrustworthy or as carriers of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).

However, the relationship between brain activity, perceived trustworthiness of others, and perceived likelihood of acquiring an STD was unclear prior to a recent study published in eNeuro. In the study led by Daniela Mier at the University of Konstanz, participants viewed pictures of people and assessed their trustworthiness. The same images had been evaluated in a previous study as having high or low odds of HIV transmission. People in the images with lower perceived odds of HIV transmission were generally considered more trustworthy in the current study by Mier's group.

Brain imaging revealed that perceived low risk of HIV transmission and high trustworthiness both resulted in higher activation of a brain region in the reward network, which may be a ""safety signal"" in the brain. Conversely, people with higher perceived odds of HIV transmission were more often deemed untrustworthy by participants. But comparisons across groups showed that distrust alone-and not necessarily high likelihood of HIV transmission-led to more activation of brain regions in a different network called the salience network, which may serve as the brain's ""alarm signal.""

Ultimately, how humans perceive others seems to alter the activation of reward and salience networks that might play a role in making assessments about the risk others pose to one's own safety.",2025-02-11T10:57:00+00:00,https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250211/Trust-and-risk-perception-influence-brain-activity-in-health-assessments.aspx,046f9bf8efb54c92bd1463cb24b7229c
"Inside his home, a man was shot dead by criminals who fled aboard a car, in the La Alianza neighborhood, in Monterrey.

The aggression was recorded on Monday night on Progreso Street between olive trees and soldiers, in an irregular zone.

The victim allegedly was surprised when he slept in his room.

The deceased was identified by his neighbors only with the nickname of ""star"", between 28 and 30 years.

It transpired that the aggressors broke into the house and shot at their goal, and then fled on board a car.

The man received at least two bullet impacts on his face and one in his hand.

Because the area is difficult to access, the Red Cross paramedics and Civil Force police took to arrive, until they were finally oriented by the neighbors.

Although they tried to revive him, he no longer had vital signs.

The area was cordoned off while ministerial agents carried out the inquiries.

In another fact related to public safety, federal authorities dismantled a laboratory of synthetic drugs and chemical precursors in the municipality of Garcia, Nuevo León.

The security device and inspection were carried out a property on Humberto Lobo Street, in the Complex Industrial Mitras neighborhood.

According to a statement, different chemical substances were found, including sulfuric acid and caustic soda in various containers and iron drums.

The property was sealed and under police protection, as long as the insured was made available to the corresponding Public Ministry agent, who will continue with the case investigation folder.

It was detailed that the search was made in attention to a citizen complaint with the participation elements of the Ministry of Citizen Security and Protection (SSPC), Secretariat of National Defense (Defense), Secretary of the Navy (Semar), Attorney General's Office of the Republic (FGR) and National Guard (GN).",2025-02-11T12:23:44+00:00,https://www.telediario.mx/policia/monterrey-asesinan-a-balazos-a-hombre-dentro-de-su-casa,982ca40d80ca4f6e8cec24c0e80371af
"This Morning was disrupted on Tuesday (11 February) as Martin Lewis made a significant announcement. The financial journalist joined the ITV show to share the latest money-saving tips and debt avoidance strategies with hosts Cat Deeley and Ben Shephard.

As Martin's segment kicked off, Cat introduced him to TV viewers, revealing he would discuss credit scores on the show. However, before the segment could get underway, Ben and Cat interrupted so Martin could announce news about his own ITV programme, The Martin Lewis Money Show, ahead of this week's episode.

Ben disclosed that Martin had a special Valentine's Day edition of his ITV show lined up, leading him and Cat to rib Martin about his lack of enthusiasm for the holiday.

""Valentine's is a wonderful celebration for card shops and chocolate sellers. It's not that romantic, most people would rather get rid of it when I do polling on it,"" Martin quipped.

Ben then teased about Martin's wife, Lara Lewington. The TV star joked that Lara had been anticipating Martin ""spoiling her"" on Valentine's Day and had mentioned it during a recent visit to the ITV studio.

The trio shared a laugh as Martin maintained that it would ""never happen"" due to his stance on celebrating Valentine's Day, reports Wales Online.

Martin then continued, revealing the theme of his programme: ""It's actually a very important show. I'm going to be going through the nine benefits of marriage.""

He told TV viewers that his ITV show would not follow its traditional Tuesday evening slot but air on Thursday this week.

His much-watched show returns to the screens on Thursday, 13 February, at 8p.m., providing a 60-minute deep dive into matrimony and the fiscal side of tying the knot.

This live show is a staple on ITV. It is currently running in its 14th series, with the latest season starting in January. The show tackles subjects such as debt, bills, and taxes.

"Just when you think Liz Cheney has finally run out of ways to humiliate herself, she finds a new one. This time, she’s taking a potshot at Elon Musk because her new job is apparently screaming at anyone not on the Manhattan cocktail circuit.

At this point, Liz is the craziest Lizzie to enter the national consciousness since Lizzie Borden. And now that she’s done a hatchet job on J.D. Vance and Elon Musk, she deserves a few whacks back—with some cutting remarks.

Liz fired off a snippy “Damn right” in response to Musk calling her out over her past involvement with USAID. (Which, fun fact, is the federal agency known for spraying U.S. taxpayer money around the world like Dick Cheney sprays lead while hunting—indiscriminately, with questionable aim, and usually hitting the wrong target.)

Musk, of course, dared to question the wisdom of this, and for his trouble, Cheney took a thinly veiled swipe at his immigrant status.

Yes, you read that right. The same Liz Cheney who would faint into her non-fat oat milk latte if a conservative questioned someone’s citizenship just did that exact thing to Elon Musk.

If this is the new standard, might I suggest a national revival of the 1970s–80s sitcom Benson?

After all, if Liz Cheney can take cheap shots at an immigrant, maybe we can bring back a show about a politically incorrect but fundamentally decent butler—who somehow managed to climb the ranks from Director of Household Affairs to Budget Director, then Lt. Governor, and finally gubernatorial candidate.

The 1980s were fun, folks—back when social mobility meant moving up in the world, not moving six feet apart for social distancing.

Now, all of this raises an important philosophical question: How much of Liz Cheney’s insufferable self-righteousness is just hereditary?

Because let’s be honest, if she were anyone else—not the heiress of the House of Cheney—her “political career” would consist of attempting to extol the virtue of sheepherding at the Wyoming Cattlemen’s Association, wondering why nobody in the room is applauding.

And since we’re on the subject of Cheney family traditions, I have a suggestion: Liz, Dick, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz should go pheasant hunting together. Governor, you might want to pass on that. Because if there’s one thing we know about Big Dick Cheney, it’s that you never let him slip behind you in a hunting scenario.

Liz is probably still confused about why her farewell tour is getting worse Yelp reviews than a vegan steakhouse in Laramie. After all, she gets invited to all the “right” cocktail parties in Manhattan, inside the Beltway, and maybe even Jackson Hole. The problem? The rest of Wyoming—the actual Wyoming—wants nothing to do with her.

To borrow a phrase from corporate HR, she is persona non grata in her “home” state.

But let’s keep it real: she isn’t going anywhere. I’m still looking at the House Oversight Committee report, and believe me, I have questions. On the other hand, Liz has TV hits to do and progressives to impress.

So, until the Cheney Farewell Tour finally reaches its last stop, I’ll be here enjoying the show—and, of course, making sure nobody lets Big Dick Cheney get behind them with a shotgun.

"""We've built a facility focused on automation and efficiency, allowing us to produce over 100 grams of high-quality flower per square foot,"" shares Jarrod Falite, Co-Founder of Bostica. Located in Lynn, Massachusetts, the Tier 4 cultivator operates a 60,000-square-foot facility with 35,000 square feet of vertical canopy, including triple-tiered vegetation rooms and double-tiered flower rooms. ""When encountering Fluence at a trade show, we realized that doubling our canopy and using LED lights made perfect sense,"" Jarrod added.





Putting efficiency first

In a mature Massachusetts market that is experiencing price compression, Bostica's approach is to focus on efficiency. ""The team is small but highly effective, utilizing environmental and operational data to enhance decision-making. We're deliberate and cautious with every move,"" Jarrod says. This careful planning extends to the strains they cultivate. With 18 proprietary strains, Bostica emphasizes traits that align with their vertical setup, such as appropriate plant height, and deprioritizes traits like dense foliage that are too labor intensive. ""Some strains may be great for home growers or single-tier growers, but they're not suitable for our high-efficiency operation,"" Jarrod notes.

Coming from a family with more than 40 years of experience in the HVAC business, Jarrod brings a unique advantage to Bostica. ""That experience allows me to identify and solve facility challenges quickly,"" he says. ""This knowledge proved invaluable during the commissioning phase of the facility and whenever technical issues arise.""





Choosing LED lights

Jarrod recalls first encountering Fluence at a trade show in 2018, at a time when HPS was still a popular choice among growers. ""We saw vertical racks with their LED lights and immediately recognized the potential to double our canopy using LEDs."" Since then, Fluence's SPYDR fixtures have become integral to Bostica's operations.

Tim Kiefer, Sales Manager North America at Fluence, praises Bostica's forward-thinking approach: ""Jarrod and his team built their operation the right way, focusing on efficiency and scalability from the beginning. They put themselves ahead of the others that way.""

The SPYDR fixtures are specifically designed for multi-tier setups, enabling optimal light distribution while generating less heat than traditional HPS systems. ""They've allowed us to achieve great yields and preserve terpenes,"" Jarrod shares. ""Features like dimming and sunset simulation make a significant difference in plant performance and energy efficiency.""



A wild ride

Both Bostica and Fluence view their partnership as a wild ride, evolving along with the cannabis industry. ""We've learned a lot together to create better solutions and products for cannabis growers,"" Tim says. Jarrod echoes this sentiment, emphasizing Fluence's dedication to service: ""Their team includes experts in different sectors who provide great support. If you have a question, they've probably seen it before and know the answer.""",2025-02-11T11:59:58+00:00,https://www.verticalfarmdaily.com/article/9703863/us-ma-doubling-our-canopy-and-using-led-lights-made-perfect-sense/,a95677054b0045dc80a6f46c17226892
"The Arab Council for Asset, Facility, and Maintenance Management concluded the 22nd International Asset, Facility, and Maintenance Management Conference, in partnership with several government entities, as well as local, regional, and international organizations. The conference announced several important recommendations aimed at developing the asset, facility, and maintenance management sector.

The conference was attended by experts from the United Arab Emirates, including Engineer Ali Al-Suwaidi, Vice President of the American University of Sharjah, and Dr. Asma Al-Nuaimi, Head of the Continuing Education Center at the University of Sharjah, along with representatives from the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure and the Sharjah Public Works Department.

During the opening ceremony, which was held under the patronage of His Royal Highness Prince Khalid Al-Faisal, Advisor to the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques and Governor of Makkah Region, Professor Dr. Mufid Al-Samarrai was honored with the ""Lifetime Achievement Award"" in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the field of building maintenance and sustainability.

Dr. Mufid Al-Samarrai, a former faculty member in the Civil Engineering Department at the University of Sharjah and an educational consultant for the ""Ready"" program under the patronage of Sharjah Holding, is a pioneer in the field of building maintenance and sustainability. He has achieved numerous milestones, including several patents, the maintenance of over 100 buildings and bridges in Iraq, Jordan, and the UAE, and participation in more than 240 research papers and workshops in the fields of material engineering, building repair, sustainability, heritage building maintenance, and the application of artificial intelligence in these areas.

Dr. Mufid Al-Samarrai stated: ""I dedicate this honor to His Highness Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi, Member of the Supreme Council and Ruler of Sharjah, who has supported science and scientists and provided them with the appropriate environment and climate. Through his vision and aspirations, education and academic institutions in Sharjah and the UAE have become beacons from which students draw the right principles to embark on new horizons, forming the most important foundation for their educational and professional journeys.""

He added: ""I feel immense pride and humility to receive the Lifetime Achievement Award from OMAINTEC, and I extend my deepest gratitude to the Council for this recognition. My presence and workshop presentations after more than six decades in this field demonstrate that one should never stop learning and keeping up with developments in their specialty. For example, the advent of artificial intelligence today requires a complete re-evaluation of curricula, standards, and performance indicators.""

Based on the lectures, workshops, discussions, and interventions during the conference, several recommendations were made. These included urging various institutions to focus on artificial intelligence applications and providing the appropriate environment and frameworks to activate them in asset, facility, and maintenance management. This is due to their significant impact on improving performance quality, reducing costs, and supporting maintenance decisions. The recommendations also emphasized the need to consider cyber security requirements to protect facility management systems and adopt maintenance strategies that leverage artificial intelligence, smart technologies, and sensors for inspecting and maintaining service systems and infrastructure.",2025-02-11T12:17:24.027000+00:00,https://www.zawya.com/en/press-release/events-and-conferences/experts-from-the-uae-attend-the-22nd-international-asset-facility-and-maintenance-management-conference-mx2wqafq,a2ac7c314b0642f48cea046168a6ef06
"Ian Ferguson, who was working in his family business on the day a massive car bomb devastated the centre of the Co Tyrone town, told the Omagh Bombing Inquiry that his life was changed forever.

The inquiry has moved into a new phase and is hearing from witnesses and people who were injured in the 1998 Real IRA attack.

The public inquiry was set up by the Government to examine whether the explosion, which killed 29 people including the mother of unborn twins, could have been prevented by the UK authorities.

Giving evidence, Mr Ferguson said he was working in the Spick And Span dry cleaning business on the day of the bombing.

He said it was a “typical Saturday morning” and people in the street outside his shop were “happy and joyful”.

Mr Ferguson said that following an alert he was preparing to leave his shop when the bomb exploded.

He said: “The rails with the garments at the back of the shop fell to the floor. The smoke alarms and screaming started.

“The two girls I had working with me, they started to panic.

“I have a back yard so I took them out to ensure they were safe.”

Mr Ferguson said he took his staff members away from the scene and left them in the care of a police officer before returning to his shop.

He said he noticed that the engine of the car which had exploded was still on fire.

Mr Ferguson said: “I went back into the shop and took two fire extinguishers.

“Me and another gentleman, I don’t know who it was, started to put the blaze out.

“From that, it was just carnage, the screaming and crying, the smell of smoke, it was just terrible.

“I started then to help people, lifting them off the ground.

“I remember lifting a lady on to a piece of wood and using it as a stretcher to take her down the street.

“I don’t know how long but I spent most of the day carrying people.”

Mr Ferguson said he then went back to his shop to let his parents know he was safe but was so disorientated he could not remember their phone number, so called a friend to contact his parents.

He said: “I went back out to help again. There were people bleeding, so I brought towels, blankets, anything I could get from the shop to use as bandages to help people.

“I don’t know how long it lasted. I met the late Father (Kevin) Mullan on the street.

“He was giving people the last rites and I was putting sheets over them.”

He added: “I went home that evening, I can’t remember what time.

“I felt so thankful to be home. A lot of people went to town that day and never came home.”

Mr Ferguson told the inquiry he had been fighting against depression ever since and does not like to be in large crowds.

He said: “That day changed the whole layout of the street.

“I lost so many friends and colleagues who never came back to work.

“On a Saturday evening we would have met up after work and had a drink and talked about how our week went.

“That has never happened since because people have left.”

A barrister then read statements to the inquiry provided by two women, Valerie Hamilton and Edel Doherty, who were in Omagh when the bomb exploded.

Ms Hamilton was working in a shop when she was told by police she needed to evacuate.

Recalling the moment the car bomb detonated, she said: “There was a flash and an immense heat, I put my hands up to my head and I shouted ‘no!’.

“The bomb had exploded. The next thing I knew I was sitting at Shop Electric on the pavement, in the foetal position with my hands still up at the side of my head.

“I don’t know how I got there.

“When I opened my eyes all that I could see was the smoke and debris everywhere and the smell of burning.”

Ms Hamilton suffered serious eye injuries, a fractured hand and multiple shrapnel wounds and still suffers from hearing loss and anxiety.

Her statement said: “I take medication to help with anxiety caused by what I saw that day because what I saw can never be unseen.

“It causes me so much stress and tension that I have chronic pain as I relive that day every day.”

Ms Doherty’s statement said she had been shopping in the town.

After the explosion, she made her way towards the town centre to search for a family member.

She said: “I was approached by a policeman, he asked if I had any first aid training.

“I followed him into Boot’s chemists where he directed me to lift anything which would absorb blood, like nappies or sanitary products.

“I proceeded to run, carrying the products towards the area of the bomb.

“It was chaos. People were screaming, crying and I remember meeting ash-covered faces. I could only see their eyes.

“There was a horrible smell and alarms were ringing constantly.”

Ms Doherty said she found a young boy lying in the street.

She said: “He was lying on his back, he was conscious, his eyes were open but he was not talking.

“I knew his injuries were severe and beyond my skills to fix.

“There was a door lying nearby. We used this as a stretcher.”

She said she placed the boy in the rear of a police Land Rover.

She said: “The sights that I saw that day remain with me to this day.

“They were horrendous, body parts, pieces of flesh, broken bodies and water and blood gushing down the street.

“Casualties with clothes blown off them, the walking wounded wandering around like zombies.”",2025-02-11T12:13:09+00:00,https://www.swindonadvertiser.co.uk/news/national/24926365.omagh-bombing-survivor-tells-inquiry-placed-sheets-victims-bodies/,82dcc5426af04747a27899e77f12022c
"New York Fashion Week is well underway, and Monday night saw one of the most highly anticipated shows on the schedule take place, Tory Burch. The designer this season presented her take on ""twisted American sportswear"" and had a star-studded front row on hand to support, which included actress Jodie Turner-Smith, who loves the label for its ability to empower women, she tells us.

For the occasion, the British star opted for some very chic tailoring in the form of a brown wool jacket, grey trousers and some snakeskin boots, which is her go-to uniform – she says she is drawn to elegant tailoring and trousers that elongate her legs, which this look certainly achieved.

With the help of her expert team, Turner-Smith has created a name for herself on the fashion circuit as somebody who is not afraid to take risks. She says that her style is constantly evolving with her, and it is pure confidence that makes a look work.

See what she had to say when we caught up with her ahead of the show, and discover more from the catwalks here.

How did you decide on the look for today's show?

""I am very drawn to clothing that feels elegantly tailored, nodding towards a time before this one and also hinting at masculine energy – structure, shoulders with emphasis and exaggeration, trousers that make legs appear to go on for days. And always, a statement handbag.""

How do you decide which brands you want to work with, and what makes Tory Burch such a great fit for your personal style?

""I love to work with brands that value strong and empowered women, that also support and elevate women. I take this very seriously and I love to wear and work with brands that I feel resonate and are representative of some truth that exists inside one of the many women inside of me. Tory Burch is that for me.""

How involved do you tend to be with the styling process?

""I am a woman of many opinions — so of course, I make those known. I believe wholeheartedly in being an active part of the conversation, but I also believe in trusting in my collaborators. They bring their expertise and I bring me— and I am the world's leading expert on the subject of me. It is from this place, knowing we are all bringing something invaluable to the table, that we make magic.""

What kind of fashion makes you feel your most confident?

""I am my most comfortable when I believe in something, so whatever iteration of myself I am bringing to life with a look, I am feel the most confident when I believe in it and believe in myself.""

How has your style evolved over the years?

""My style is constantly evolving because I am constantly evolving. My tastes evolve and my body changes. I am a different person today than I was yesterday and I definitely can't wear platforms seven days a week anymore if I want to have a healthy back and knees.""

What has been your most memorable fashion moment in recent years and why?

""My most memorable fashion moment of late would have to be last years Vanity Fair Oscars party look because the highlight of the outfit was not the dress. The highlight was me showcasing the rich dark moisturised skin that God has blessed me with!""

Whose style have you always admired and why?

""I admire anyone who appears to fully commit to expressing whatever their idea of self is – those who wear the clothes, and do not let the clothes wear them.""

Fashion has a reputation for being frivolous, but why does what we wear matter?

""I don’t believe that fashion is frivolous. Fanciful, yes, and curing cancer, we are not. But I firmly believe that self-expression, and the joy that comes along with it, is an act of resistance. That matters.""",2025-02-11T11:46:39.231328+00:00,https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/a63752744/jodie-turner-smith-tory-burch-show/,75c5678a7896411b80a61e26f38af821

"A train operator said it has recovered £12,000 from a habitual fare dodger who offended 736 times.

Chiltern Railways said the culprit, who it did not name, committed instances of “fraudulent reclaims of money, knowingly not paying the correct fare and railcard abuse”.

A total of 8,064 cases were reported for investigation by Chiltern’s economic crime, fraud and prosecutions unit last year.

More than £1 million of lost revenue was recovered during the period.

This is in addition to the 2,156 penalty fares issued, which resulted in more than £114,000 being recovered, Chiltern Railways said.

Penalty fares are issued as a surcharge on top of the price of the single fare for a passenger’s journey.

They should only be issued in instances where there were facilities to buy a ticket at a passenger’s departure station and the person passed signs stating the consequences of not having a ticket.

In January 2023, the Department for Transport increased the cost of the penalty fare to £100 after it was frozen at £20 for more than a decade.

It is reduced to £50 if paid within 21 days.

Tony Baxter, operations director at Chiltern Railways, said: “The vast majority of our customers pay for their tickets before they travel but unfortunately there is still a lot of money lost on the railway through fare evasion every year.

“We are determined to ensure fairness for the paying customer, and there is no excuse for fare evasion as it has never been simpler to purchase a ticket.

“Anyone risking boarding without buying the correct ticket for their journey is at risk of a penalty fare or prosecution.”

Industry body the Rail Delivery Group previously estimated that around £240 million is lost through fare evasion on Britain’s railways each year.

In January, watchdog Transport Focus urged all operators in Britain to introduce a so-called yellow card system, which would mean passengers caught without a ticket being let off with a warning for a first offence.

Chiltern Railways runs services between London Marylebone and locations in Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Warwickshire, as well as longer-distance services to and from the West Midlands.

"Legal Practitioner and Family law expert, Maurice Ampaw has revealed that he had once charged an outrageous fee which was not what he usually charged a couple just to save the marriage.

According to him, the woman gave the most unusual reason he had ever heard for a divorce case and it was that she was no longer in love with her husband. He recounted when the couple came to him with the woman asking for a divorce and stating her reason.

Ampaw then charged them outrageous fees which he normally wouldn’t charge in hopes that she might change her mind but she fully paid the fees without asking for a reduction.

He even intentionally increased the time duration telling them it would take more than six months but the woman still insisted on seeing it through.

Days later, the man came to his office telling him he still loved his wife and that it wasn’t the first time she had initiated a divorce so he begged Ampaw to hold on with the proceedings.

However, he relayed the information to the woman who then told him not to allow her husband to deceive him and that if Ampaw stopped the process, she would see him as being unprofessional.

Speaking on the GTV Breakfast show, the family law expert recounted that he went ahead and filed the case before the court. The woman was then asked what her reason was and she mentioned that she was no longer in love with her husband however the Judge told her that was not enough reason to file for a divorce and her reason was not part of the eight reasons for which one could file for divorce including the grounds of infidelity, unreasonable behavior, desertion and others.

Ampaw revealed the woman then accused him of trying to stop the divorce process.

After it was adjourned for some days, the Judge asked the woman again to give him one valid reason for which he would grant her the divorce she so much desired.

It was then she said, ‘’I don’t enjoy sex with my husband and for almost five years now I haven’t felt anything when he touches me’’

The Judge granted the divorce based on the grounds of sexual dissatisfaction.

Ampaw went on to reveal that It was days later when he found out that the woman’s ex had just returned from Canada and was the one financing the whole divorce proceedings.",2025-02-11T12:13:57+00:00,https://www.gbcghanaonline.com/entertainment/save-a-marriage/2025/,6b62b61a66c4466787eb1f3001ee35c5

"Meet The Blood Man Of Bihar Mukesh Hisaria Who Saved 50,000 Lives By Setting Up A Large Blood Donation Network

Patna: Mukesh Hisaria's phone keeps on ringing and all calls are related to blood. From the common man to ministers to senior officers, when there is an urgent need for blood, they contact Mukesh Hisaria. Mukesh shares that he receives on average 10 calls in an hour. Mukesh is known as the 'Blood Man of Bihar'. So far he has made available blood to over 70,000 needy people. Not only this, he is fond of doing social work. He has also helped in conducting the marriage of over 550 needy women free of cost. ""It was 1991, my mother's health deteriorated. We took her to Vellore for treatment. At that time, the kin of the other patients needed blood. Those who got blood had a smile on their face. Meanwhile, the doctors said that my mother needed to be operated on and it could be fatal. However, the operation was successful,"" Hisaria told ETV Bharat. He said that after his mother recovered he thought of donating blood but did not know that it could be done only after completing 18 years of age. ""I had said to doctors, if my mother recovered, I would donate blood. My mother recovered a month and a half after the operation. After that, I donated blood for the first time. After that twice a year, I used to visit a blood bank and donate blood. I continued this for 15 years,"" he added. According to Mukesh Hisaria, the turning point in his journey came in 2006. ""I was sitting at my medical shop on Govind Mitra Road. A 12-year-old child came to me crying. I asked the child why he was in tears. He said his mother was admitted and needed B-positive blood. It reminded me of 1991 when my mother was admitted,"" he recalled. ""There was Orkut platform then. I posted in the morning that B-positive blood was needed. I was scolded by my friends for putting up the post. However, one of my friends Sanjay Agarwal donated the blood to the needy woman,"" he remembered.

According to Mukesh, he had forgotten about the incident. ""However, after a fortnight, the child came to my shop with his mother and the mother touched my feet. I was speechless, as I had not donated blood or treated her. I was just a medium to arrange the blood. After this, I decided to help the needy. I started arranging blood donation camps. Blood donation became my passion. After blood donation, the blood was sent to PMCH,"" he added. He then decided to start a blood bank. ""I started an organisation - 'Ma Vaishavdevi Seva Samiti' and started a book bank in 2022. An idol of Ma Vaishnav Devi was installed in it and it was inaugurated by Nitish Kumar,"" he recalled. He shares a unit of blood can save the lives of three to four patients. ""I have all the advanced equipment in the blood bank. Since the start, 12500 units of blood have been received. The cost in a government blood bank is Rs 500 and my rate is similar for a unit. The processing cost is Rs 1450. If any needy woman comes, she is given blood free of cost. Even those who do not have any relatives in Patna and finding a donor becomes difficult, such persons are also given blood free of cost. Cancer and Thalassemia patients are also given blood free of cost"" he added. He has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying that there should be a column of blood in standard 10 examinations. ""It should have information on whether blood thalassemia is minor or not. It will help while the children get married,"" he contended. I have helped 57 children do the bone-marrow transplant. ""I had urged Nitish Kumar in 2012-13 to help the needy children with bone marrow transplants. Now the Bihar government does bone marrow transplants for children. The state government gives Rs 10 lakh while the Centre provides financial assistance of Rs 3 lakh,"" he added. He said around 40 people donate Rs 5000 per month to his organisation and the money is used for different purposes. He says he is also being helped by businessmen. Mukesh recalled that he shared the stage with Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan while he was promoting his movie Fan in 2016. ""I have also visited the Kapil Sharma show,"" he recalled.

RIAA certifications are awarded based on U.S. digital single and album sales, with Gold status requiring 500,000 units, Platinum for 1 million, Multi-Platinum for 2 million, and Diamond for 10 million units.

These units include physical and digital album sales, digital downloads, and weighted audio and video streaming figures.With this, TXT now holds three RIAA Gold certifications. In 2023, they became the first K-pop act after BTS to receive a Gold certification for their fifth mini-album ‘The Name Chapter: TEMPTATION.’

This achievement reflects their solid fanbase in North America, which they further strengthened during their ‘TOMORROW X TOGETHER WORLD TOUR .’ They performed at two North American stadiums, as well as New York’s Madison Square Garden, a venue graced by legendary artists like The Rolling Stones and Taylor Swift.

‘0X1=LOVESONG (I Know I Love You) feat. Seori’ is the title track of TXT’s second full-length album, ‘The Chaos Chapter: FREEZE’ (2021). A hybrid pop-rock song, it conveys a young boy’s ""self-assured love""—believing that despite life’s chaos, his feelings for one person are certain. The track was named No. 1 on Billboard’s ""25 Best K-pop Songs of 2021"" list, earning critical acclaim.

Meanwhile, ‘Blue Hour’ is the title track of their third mini-album, ‘minisode1: Blue Hour’ (2020). The song captures the mixed emotions of teenagers as they experience both familiarity and unfamiliarity while gazing at the beautiful sky at 5:53 PM in October’s sunset.

TXT is set to kick off ‘TOMORROW X TOGETHER WORLD TOUR - EP.2’ from March 7th to 9th at Inspire Arena in Incheon. The tour will then expand to London, Berlin, Paris, Amsterdam, and various cities in Japan, including Kanagawa, Kagawa, Aichi, Fukuoka, Osaka, and Tokyo, before concluding in Macau. Notably, this marks TXT’s first time expanding their tour to Europe, further solidifying their growing global presence.

Kenya Rugby Union chairman Sasha Mutai has intimated the union’s target of lobbying to host a leg of the prestigious HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series in the years to come.

The rugby supremo who has overseen the return of Kenya Sevens rugby team, Shujaa, to the World Series says their immediate concern is helping the team cement their status in the league as they eye the ultimate goal of hosting a leg of the series

“We also want to host the HSBC sevens. We talked to the head of the sevens program in World Rugby last year when we were in Spain with former sports minister Ababu Namwamba, so we started talks about that.”

Mutai opines that it's also imperative that the union return the stature of the esteemed Safari 7s to global stardom, as that will be a good launching pad for hosting a leg of the world series.

“We have to build Safari 7s back to what it was. This year, the tournament will run from 10-12 October 2025; we have invited some big teams, and we are just waiting for confirmation in the next few weeks.

“We want to grow it back to what it was and exceed that so that we can be serious contenders.

Kenya commands a cult following in the HSBC Sevens series, and the recent move by organizers of the Perth 7s tournament to allocate Kenyan fans a specific stand cemented Kenya’s importance in the world league.",2025-02-11T12:03:02+00:00,https://www.citizen.digital/sports/kru-in-ambitious-bid-to-host-hsbc-sevens-n357421,03d3ec1b0ce449a680106c0ea5ada722

"THIS Morning's Cat Deeley has faced backlash after she grimaced and threatened to SPIT OUT food from Asda’s Valentine’s Day Meal Deal today.

Presenter Cat, 48, who was sampling the budget supermarket's £11.97 offer, left fans unimpressed with her reaction, with some calling her comments ""rude"" and ""snobbish"".

The meal deal included a lasagne, vegetable medley with focaccia and pesto, a vanilla panna cotta heart, and Kylie Minogue’s 0% alcohol Prosecco.

Cat and her co-host Ben Shephard, both thought to be on £600k per year at ITV, gave their thoughts on the dishes - but Cat wasn’t exactly sold on the dessert.

When it came to the panna cotta, she described it as ""a bit wobbly"" and ""custardy"", adding that it lacked ""enough texture"" to her liking and tasted like ""baby food"".

Ben, however, had a different take, saying, ""I really like that actually. The jelly with the panna cotta works really nicely.""

He also joked, “And Kylie can do no wrong in my eyes.""

Cat responded, “Kylie can do no wrong, but this is just a bit…” she trailed off, before bursting into fits of laughter.

As she looked away from the camera and grimaced, Ben even asked if she ""wanted a straw"".

A contributor on the show, who had been tasked with promoting the meal deal, called the dishes ""rich"" and ""easy to cook,"" urging viewers buy it for themselves.

However, Cat's less-than-enthusiastic response soon sparked a wave of backlash on social media.

Fans took to X, formerly, Twitter to voice their fury, with one user writing, “Cat is as rude as f**k,” while another raged, “Cat the snob!!”

A third said: ""Cat has no etiquette whatsoever.""

Someone else joked: ""Currently have an image of the @Asda head of marketing and the team all Sat around a big screen waiting for the valentines section... 'it tastes like baby food.'""

While one more concluded: ""She’s so rude..some people will be grateful to Asda for selling a full meal for less than £12 for Valentine’s Day, yet she’s slagged it off, stupid bloody bint!""

Cat made another blunder last month when she accidentally dropped a huge hint Ant and Dec are planning to bring back SMTV Live after their Saturday Night Takeaway exit.

She told how the presenting duo are keen to relaunch the kids' programme, which she fronted alongside them in the 90s and 00s.

Cat and Ben were joined by SMTV alum Stephen Mulhern, 47, who gushed about his time on the children's favourite.

As clips from his early telly days were shown on-screen, Cat gushed about her pals' plans for the future.

Watching on from the studio sofa, Stephen mourned the demise of kids' weekend shows, claiming they're ""missed"".

Cat soon interjected: ""Actually, Ant and Dec have been talking about maybe bringing back a Saturday morning kids' show. Be great if they did.""

Ben, seemingly privy to their inside talks, finished Cat's sentence, saying: ""Saturday morning kids' stuff.""",2025-02-11T12:17:41+00:00,https://www.thesun.ie/tv/14696135/this-mornings-cat-deeley-threatens-spit-out-food-supermarket/,a021ed1deb5f413ca0269cbcf500853a

"Residents of the Balakhninsky district complained to Vladimir Putin at the local garbage training ground. The townspeople said that for many years they were fighting with a landfill, but to no avail. Now they are afraid of expanding the landfill and increasing its hazard class. The situation was commented on in the Ministry of Ecology of the Nizhny Novgorod Region.

According to local residents, they want to change the danger class of the Balakhninsky training ground 4.5 kilometers from the city center to a higher-from P-2 to P-1. That is, extremely dangerous waste can be brought here.

-We ask you to close the Balakhninsky training ground and ban the transfer of land from the P-2 in the P-1 category, since in the future, perhaps, nuclear waste, waste from cattle traders will be imported to us. This is all very dangerous, ”a local resident said on a video recorded to the president.

The Balakhninians are afraid that the situation will not only lead to soil pollution, and will adversely affect the state of the Volga, since the polygon filtrate can go into the water.

- The authorities do not listen to us, there is an expansion of the landfill, there is a change in the hazard class, they are transported by the waste that cannot be taken here. This all harms us and - most importantly - to future generations, ”said a resident of Balakhna.

The regional Ministry of Ecology reported that a change in the hazard class of the facility is needed in connection with the decision of the chief sanitary doctor of the Russian Federation on the establishment of the sanitary protection zone of such enterprises into one kilometer. At the same time, it is not planned to expand the area of ​​the landfill or bring waste of a higher class, according to the department.

-The information distributed on social networks about the delivery of any types of waste to the landfill, in addition to those that were previously, are not confirmed by the ministry, ”the department added.

At the same time, the waste sorting complex will be reconstructed. And the waste processing power is here at least to increase from 40 to 100 thousand tons per year.

“That is, while maintaining the existing amounts of waste to the landfill, the reconstruction will significantly reduce the amount of waste sent to the burial and increase the share of raw materials involved in the secondary turn,” the authorities answered.

They also added that in addition to this, the construction of communications and networks is provided for collecting and disinfecting waste, which will be placed in the future. After cleaning, part of the effluents will be used, including to fill fire reservoirs and use it in production processes.

Another problem with garbage training grounds is fires on them. For example, we reported that last year the Gorodetsky district of the Nizhny Novgorod region enveloped caustic smoke: the large garbage training ground of the company Citymatic Nizhny Novgorod caught fire. The fire area grew by 35 thousand squares, and garbage continued to smolder for several weeks.",2025-02-11T11:24:00+00:00,https://www.nn.ru/text/ecology/2025/02/11/75094313/,0ce4cfbb76e54e7a85ee404b8c8ece3d
"Brian Schottenheimer's promotion to head coach of the Cowboys wasn't a decision many saw coming, but Jerry Jones sees the move as part of an overall strategy that will get Dallas into contention immediately, Michael Baca of NFL.com reports.

""The decisions I'm making are not based on rebuilding,"" Jones said Thursday night at NFL Honors, via The Associated Press. ""They're based on competing. And competing now. The decisions I made last year were based on competing now. Now they didn't exactly work out. But I think I paid Dak (Prescott) more than anybody's ever been paid in the NFL. That's now. That's not the future. We're excited about our team's ability to compete right now.""

When the Cowboys formally introduced Schottenheimer, Jones wasn't afraid to call the hiring a first-year head coach ""as big a risk as you can take."" Considering the make-up of the Cowboys roster, namely with Dak Prescott at quarterback and CeeDee Lambat wideout, Jones on Thursday expressed confidence that an in-house promotion will benefit a team that had made the playoffs in three of the past four seasons.

""It gives us some continuity but lets us have a new shot at it,"" Jones said of Schottenheimer, who had been with the Cowboys the past three years.

Schottenheimer does have the benefit of familiarity with the offense, as Jones pointed out. The son of famed coach Marty Schottenheimer, Brian has a wealth of experience having been in the league for 25 seasons, mostly as an offensive coordinator.

""We called it osmosis, sitting around the breakfast table,"" Jones said. ""He made a young lifetime out of asking his father to help him, being around organizations so he could as much football as he possibly could. So, he's no accident. But he's actually had a lot of experience to be a first-time head coach. I thought we could bet on that.""

"• Lagos e-hailing driver Yusfat Ayinde was fatally attacked by unidentified assailants who ambushed him during a ride request and stole his vehicle
• The Amalgamated Union of App-Based Transporters of Nigeria has called for improved security measures and launched an investigation into the incident
• Authorities are working to track down the perpetrators, while similar past cases have heightened concerns about the safety of e-hailing drivers in Lagos

The Lagos State chapter of the Amalgamated Union of App-Based Transporters of Nigeria has expressed deep sorrow over the killing of 42-year-old e-hailing driver Yusfat Ayinde, who was fatally attacked by unidentified assailants on Friday.

Confirming the tragic incident, the union’s chairman, Jaiyesinmi Azeez, stated that Ayinde was on duty when he received a ride request through an e-hailing app.

Upon reaching the designated location, he was ambushed by a group of criminals who assaulted him before making off with his vehicle.

According to Azeez, Ayinde was a respected member of the professional chauffeur community and played an active role in supporting fellow drivers.

His remains were later discovered along Agidingbi Road in Ikeja and subsequently moved to the morgue.

The union has raised serious concerns about the security challenges faced by e-hailing drivers and is calling for stronger measures to safeguard their members.

Azeez noted that the group’s task force has launched an independent inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the attack.

He further assured that efforts were being intensified to track down those responsible and ensure they face justice.

Beyond seeking justice for Ayinde, the union is also pushing for increased security for drivers operating within Lagos. Discussions are ongoing to introduce additional safety measures, including emergency response protocols and enhanced surveillance in high-risk locations.

The union has pledged full support to Ayinde’s family and assured that they will receive necessary assistance during this difficult time.

Meanwhile, similar cases have raised concerns about driver safety in Lagos. According to a report by PUNCH, the Lagos State Police Command recently arrested a 21-year-old US returnee, David Segun, and three others for allegedly murdering an Uber driver in Obalende after luring him through a ride-hailing app.

Security agencies have been urged to intensify efforts to curb such violent crimes and bring perpetrators to justice.

Investigations into Ayinde’s case remain ongoing, with authorities working to track the suspects and prevent further attacks on e-hailing operators in the state.

"According to the author of the petition, in recent years all public transport in Kiev has actually been divided into two roles. The subway performs a main function, carrying a large number of passengers over long distances, and other transport serves as a subway. Over the past 20 years, the city has been actively built up, and now the capacity of the subway has not satisfied all demand.

In 2015, research, with the assistance of the World Bank, found that in Kiev, unfulfilled demand for main transportation is a million passengers a day - almost as much as the current metro. In fact, Kiev requires the ability to receive high -speed transportation twice as much as the present.

The same study in 2015 showed great demand for the route from Borschagivka to the city center. Currently, residents of Borshchagivka are using the subway. It is more convenient for them to get to the Svyatoshin station and immediately be in the center than to move from a tram to a ""station"" or ""Polytechnic Institute"".

In the NGO ""Passengers of Kiev"" recalled that in February 2017, Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko announced plans to continue the line of Borschagovsky high -speed tram to the Palace of Sports. Since then, the World Bank has managed to prepare its part of the documentation for receiving Kiev loan on this line, in 2020 The city has signed an order at which construction work was to be completed by the end of 2023.

"The sandwich chain has written to subscribers to tell them its Club Pret monthly subscription fee will remain at £5, saying: “At Pret, we believe in offering high-quality, organic coffee and Barista-made drinks at fantastic value.

“With Club Pret, you’ll continue to enjoy great savings on up to five Barista-made drinks per day.”

Pret had previously told subscribers that their subscription would increase to £10 a month from March 31, when a “50% off” deal ended.

It followed Pret overhauling its £360-a-year subscription in July last year in favour of 50% off up to five coffees a day for £10 a month.

The chain also removed a 20% discount on food for subscribers to end dual pricing – “something we never really got comfortable with”, it said at the time.

Under the old deal that lasted for almost four years, Club Pret membership offered up to five barista-made drinks daily for a monthly fee of £30.

In March last year, the chain implemented a crackdown to prevent Club Pret subscribers from sharing free drinks with others.

Some customers were exploiting loopholes by sharing subscription benefits, prompting the changes.

The announcement followed coffee bean prices reaching an all-time high of 4,300 US dollars (£3,356) a tonne last week, amid poor harvests, particularly in the major production areas of Brazil and Vietnam, geopolitical conflict and supply chain disruption.

But prices have continued to soar to record highs amid concerns about low stocks in Brazil, which supplies almost half of the world’s Arabica, the beans favoured by coffee shop chains.",2025-02-11T12:21:29+00:00,https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/national/24926420.pret-manger-drops-doubling-5-monthly-coffee-subscription/,caa4f340155941fa94044f642f452259
"This marks a five per cent increase compared to the same month last year.

The UK’s leading local media group recorded 53 million online visitors and 275 million page views in January.

The Eastern Daily Press was the most popular site, with nine million article page views.

The company's digital subscription strategy is also thriving, with 113,000 monthly paying digital subscribers in January, a 31 per cent increase from the previous year.

Newsquest introduced soft pay walls on most of its larger sites in 2020.

Online visitors can typically read up to 30 articles a month before paying, although a small number of articles are subscriber-only.

A digital subscription, typically priced at £4.99 per month, includes access to all the site’s content in an ad-light environment as well as an e-edition of the print paper.

"In a moment of immense pride for the Telugu and Sanskrit literary world, Brahmasri Dr. Madugula Nagaphani Sarma has been conferred the prestigious Padma Shri award for his unparalleled contributions to Indian literature, culture, and spirituality. A scholar, poet, orator, and a true torchbearer of Avadhanam, Dr. Sarma has dedicated his life to the preservation and propagation of India's rich literary and spiritual heritage.

Born in Kadavakolanu, Andhra Pradesh, into a family deeply rooted in scholarly traditions, Dr. Nagaphani Sarma was introduced to classical literature and spiritual wisdom from a young age. His prodigious intellect and devotion to the Bharatiya knowledge system became evident early on when he performed his first Avadhanam at the age of 14, earning him the title of the youngest Avadhani in the country. Since then, he has dedicated over five decades to the practice and promotion of Avadhanam, performing over 2,000 Avadhanams across the globe, mesmerizing audiences with his unparalleled mastery over poetry, memory, and philosophy.

The Art of Avadhanam: A Literary and Intellectual Marvel

Avadhanam is an extraordinary and rare literary art form requiring impeccable memory, sharp intellect, and poetic prowess. It is a unique demonstration of spontaneous composition, where the Avadhani (performer) responds to complex metrical and thematic challenges posed by multiple scholars, all while simultaneously memorizing and reproducing the composed verses without any external aid. This remarkable feat demands an in-depth understanding of Vedic scriptures, Puranas, Itihasas, Sanskrit and Telugu literature, and various philosophical doctrines.

Dr. Sarma is the only Avadhani to have performed Maha Sahasravadhanam with 1,116 scholars and Dwi Sahasravadhanam with 2,116 scholars, setting an unparalleled record in this literary tradition. Through these groundbreaking performances, he has played a pivotal role in making this once-exclusive scholarly art form more accessible to the general public.

Dr. Sarma’s contributions extend far beyond performance. About three decades ago, he founded the Avadhana Saraswathi Peetham, an ashram dedicated to the promotion of Sanskrit, Telugu literature, and Sanatana Dharma. This revered institution houses a temple dedicated to Goddess Saraswathi, the goddess of wisdom, along with a goshala (cow shelter) that nurtures over 100 indigenous cows. The Peetham is a hub of educational, cultural, and spiritual activities, providing students and scholars from diverse backgrounds an opportunity to immerse themselves in India’s timeless knowledge traditions.

Through the Peetham, Dr. Sarma has initiated numerous welfare programs aimed at fostering a deep sense of national pride and cultural awareness among the youth. His efforts have not only revived ancient literary traditions but have also instilled a renewed interest in Vedic studies and spiritual wisdom among contemporary audiences.

Inspired by the historic abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu & Kashmir, Dr. Sarma penned Vishwabharatam, a monumental Sanskrit Mahakavyam consisting of over 2,650 shlokas. This magnum opus extols the greatness of Bharat, celebrating its rich cultural heritage, spiritual essence, social harmony, diverse landscape, revered saints, social reformers, and vibrant art forms. The work embodies the aesthetic element of Shanta Rasa (serenity) and aims to promote universal peace, the restoration of Akhand Bharat, and India's emergence as Vishwaguru (the global spiritual leader). This literary masterpiece was inaugurated by Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) Chief Shri Mohan Bhagwat, further cementing its significance as a historic contribution to Indian literature and nationalism.

Dr. Sarma’s literary achievements are vast and profound. He has authored over 40 books and composed more than 33,000 poems. His contributions also include over 3,000 devotional songs and stotrams, rendered in his melodious voice, which have deeply influenced spiritual seekers across generations. Additionally, he has delivered over 11,000 hours of discourses on Sanatana Dharma, Sanskrit, and Telugu literature, effectively promoting Vedic wisdom and nationalistic ideals in society.

His captivating oratory skills and poetic genius have garnered admiration from legendary figures, including former Prime Ministers Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Shri P.V. Narasimha Rao, as well as eminent leaders such as Shri Mohan Bhagwat, Shri N. Chandrababu Naidu, Shri N.T. Rama Rao, Shri Shankar Dayal Sharma, and Shri K.R. Narayanan. His ability to blend intellect, spirituality, and poetic excellence has left an indelible mark on audiences worldwide.

Beyond his contributions as a poet and scholar, Dr. Sarma has served in key administrative roles that further reflect his commitment to cultural preservation. He held the esteemed position of Additional Secretary at Dharma Prachara Parishad, Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD), where he played a crucial role in propagating Hindu dharma and spiritual knowledge. He also served as Chairman of the Official Language Commission (Cabinet Rank), Government of Andhra Pradesh, where he championed the cause of Telugu language preservation and promotion.

The conferment of the Padma Shri award on Dr. Nagaphani Sarma is a fitting recognition of his lifelong dedication to the enrichment of Indian literature, heritage, and cultural ethos. This honor is not just a personal accolade but a moment of pride for all who cherish Telugu and Sanskrit traditions. Through his relentless efforts, he has revived a centuries-old art form, inspired countless scholars, and reinforced India’s spiritual and literary grandeur on the global stage.

Dr. Nagaphani Sarma's journey is a testament to unwavering dedication, scholarly excellence, and spiritual devotion. His contributions have not only preserved India’s literary heritage but have also paved the way for future generations to embrace and celebrate the richness of Sanskrit and Telugu literature. As an ambassador of Indian culture and wisdom, his legacy will continue to inspire scholars, poets, and spiritual seekers for years to come.

In an era where ancient traditions are often overshadowed by modernity, Dr. Madugula Nagaphani Sarma stands as a beacon of knowledge, illuminating the path for those who seek to connect with the timeless wisdom of Bharat. His Padma Shri is not just a personal milestone but a celebration of India's literary and spiritual renaissance.",2025-02-11T10:52:20+00:00,https://zeenews.india.com/india/honoured-with-padma-shri-dr-madugula-nagaphani-sarma-the-scholar-who-revived-avadhanam-2857412.html,561795b9143b4d65b024d68794f88d6e

The Chaco Gimenez, who returned to the table of the last word after accompanying his son, to finalize his signing with the AC Milan of the A Series, questioned the lack of Paunovic codes, ensuring that he had to deal with the subject only with the players, without ventilating it at a press conference.

"In the wake of recent devastating wildfires in California, Howden Re has called for reforms and action to encourage more risk capacity to help in closing the protection gap crisis in the state, saying that both traditional reinsurance and capital markets will be needed, as well as innovative risk transfer such as parametric solutions.

 

 In particular, the reinsurance broker states that “accelerated adoption of regulatory reforms, risk-based pricing, risk mitigation improvements and public-private collaboration” are the “only viable path to restoring much-needed insurance market stability.”

Howden Re’s report published today blames the California insurance market’s sub-optimal regulatory framework, the escalation of wildfire risks, and persistent underwriting losses for what it sees as a protection gap crisis in the state.

Significant underinsurance is evident in the wide gap between economic and insurance market losses from the recent Los Angeles, California wildfires.

But, analysis by the broker suggests that strategic investments in enhanced risk management and wildfire mitigation amounting to $6 billion could have cut estimated economic losses of $75 billion from the wildfires by as much as half.

Catastrophic losses from wildfires in the state and California’s regulatory environment have stifled supply and insurance market competition, by restricting risk-based pricing and making it unprofitable for private market insurers to operate there, Howden explains.

Tim Ronda, CEO of Howden Re, said, “The tragedy in California is a wake-up call. Wildfire insurance in the state can and should work long-term but to do so requires significant reform. At its core, insurance is a force for good. What we saw in California was an avoidable capacity crisis brought on by slow-moving regulation, insufficient risk mitigation measures, and a lack of competition and innovation. It is also a canary in the coal mine. Without urgent adoption of recent regulatory reforms, the situation will worsen. Not only in California, but in other high-risk markets that must study what happened and adapt accordingly before history repeats itself elsewhere. The industry must step up and partner with policymakers to create a sustainable insurance market that benefits both insureds and the broader economy. Howden has solutions and is ready to lead.”

Howden’s report calls for “a combination of regulatory modernisation, market-driven solutions, and investment in resilience,” to help stabilise California’s insurance market.

Key is rebuilding private market confidence to deploy capital and capacity, with risk commensurate pricing seen as vital, as well as mitigation efforts.

Expanded public-private partnerships are part of the proposed solution, to help distribute risk more effectively and enhance availability of insurance, alongside incentivised risk mitigation and innovative risk transfer, all with the goal of attracting capital and restoring confidence in California’s insurance market.

Julian Alovisi, Head of Research at Howden, explained, “As climate risks continue to evolve, insurers must be more agile and innovative in how they approach risk. However, this change cannot happen in a vacuum and collaboration is needed to restore balance and ensure long-term insurability. This is not just an insurance issue – it’s an economic and social imperative.”

Howden’s report states, “Public-private partnerships could play a role, initially at least in supporting private market participation, and reinsurance will be front and center of solutions that include recapitalization of the FAIR Plan, reinsurer-backed MGAs, capital market participation (ILS, ILWs) and innovative product design.

“There is also an opportunity for the insurance sector to go beyond traditional risk transfer and support risk mitigation and prevention.”

All forms of capital and capacity are required, to help California’s insurance market recover and move forwards on a more stable and healthy footing.

Howden Re notes that, “Reinsurance and capital markets are essential partners to putting the private market on a more sustainable footing.

“Both markets offer large, efficient and diversified sources of contingent capital to protect against outsized losses.”

Adding, “There is an opportunity to play an even bigger role given their participation is currently triggered at the upper end of projected loss ranges for the Los Angeles wildfires.”

In addition, Howden calls for innovative managing general agent (MGA) models to embrace alternative capital sources as well as modern risk transfer techniques.

The broker explained, “MGAs have an important role to play in enabling the redeployment of capacity into the California insurance market due to their ability to leverage technology, specialist underwriting expertise and broad risk capital access. Several innovative approaches, backed by multiple sources of third-party risk capital from Bermuda and London, are emerging.”

Product innovation is also key, with Howden calling for artificial intelligence (AI) and modern technology, as well as responsive risk transfer through parametric triggers.

“New products can also help fill coverage gaps. Parametric insurance will become an increasingly important and relevant offering as it provides pre-agreed payments when certain thresholds are exceeded and can pay out within hours or days of a loss,” Howden said.

Mutualisation of risk and community-based insurance models should also be in-scope for reforming California’s insurance market after the fires, Howden believes.

Ultimately, there is a need for a concerted approach, with regulatory reform needing to continue, both for the insurance market and also for building standards and risk mitigation, which can lay the foundations for making California risk more attractive to underwriters.

The ability to charge a risk commensurate rate for capital deployment is also vital, but reforms and mitigation are what can help to make insurance more affordable for those in wildfire risk areas, so the effort needs to span all the avenues Howden Re has highlighted.

Capital is indeed an essential partner, in all its forms and from all its sources. But capital must be able to see a way towards profitable deployment, else encouraging it back could be a challenge.

"The state Senate has rejected a bill designed to stop a carbon dioxide pipeline company from using eminent domain.

Summit Carbon Solutions is building a pipeline to bring CO2 captured from ethanol plants to a sequestration site in North Dakota. The company says it has easement agreements with most North Dakota landowners along the pipeline route.

The bill would have removed “common carrier” status from CO2 pipelines, which supporters said would stop any efforts towards eminent domain.

""Landowners in North Dakota should be able to negotiate contracts without fear of eminent domain hanging over their heads,"" said the bill's main sponsor, Sen. Jeffrey Magrum (R-Hazelton). ""This change will encourage peaceful development, instead of the civil unrest that we have been seeing, turning neighbors against neighbors.""

"PARIS (Reuters) -U.S. Vice President JD Vance told Europeans on Tuesday their “massive” regulations on artificial intelligence could strangle the technology, and rejected content moderation as “authoritarian censorship”.

The mood on AI has shifted as the technology takes root, from one of concerns around safety to geopolitical competition, as countries jockey to nurture the next big AI giant.

Vance, setting out the Trump administration’s America First agenda, said the United States intended to remain the dominant force in AI and strongly opposed the European Union’s far tougher regulatory approach.

“We believe that excessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a transformative industry,” Vance told an AI summit of CEOs and heads of state in Paris.

“We feel very strongly that AI must remain free from ideological bias and that American AI will not be co-opted into a tool for authoritarian censorship,” he added.

Vance criticised the “massive regulations” created by the EU’s Digital Services Act, as well as Europe’s online privacy rules, known by the acronym GDPR, which he said meant endless legal compliance costs for smaller firms.

“Of course, we want to ensure the internet is a safe place, but it is one thing to prevent a predator from preying on a child on the internet, and it is something quite different to prevent a grown man or woman from accessing an opinion that the government thinks is misinformation,” he said.

European lawmakers last year approved the bloc’s AI Act, the world’s first comprehensive set of rules governing the technology.

Vance is leading the American delegation at the Paris summit.

Vance also appeared to take aim at China at a delicate moment for the U.S. technology sector.

Last month, Chinese startup DeepSeek freely distributed a powerful AI reasoning model that some said challenged U.S. technology leadership. It sent shares of American chip designer Nvidia down 17%.

“From CCTV to 5G equipment, we’re all familiar with cheap tech in the marketplace that’s been heavily subsidised and exported by authoritarian regimes,” Vance said.

But he said that “partnering with them means chaining your nation to an authoritarian master that seeks to infiltrate, dig in and seize your information infrastructure. Should a deal seem too good to be true? Just remember the old adage that we learned in Silicon Valley: if you aren’t paying for the product, you are the product.”

Vance did not mention DeepSeek by name. There has been no evidence of information being able to surreptitiously flow through the startup’s technology to China’s government, and the underlying code is freely available to use and view. However, some government organisations have reportedly banned DeepSeek’s use.

Speaking after Vance, French President Emmanuel Macron said that he was fully in favour of trimming red tape, but he stressed that regulation was still needed to ensure trust in AI, or people would end up rejecting it. “We need a trustworthy AI,” he said.

European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen also said the EU would cut red tape and invest more in AI.

In a bilateral meeting, Vance and von der Leyen were also likely to discuss Trump’s substantial increase of tariffs on steel.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was expected to address the summit on Tuesday. A consortium led by Musk said on Monday it had offered $97.4 billion to buy the nonprofit controlling OpenAI.

Altman promptly posted on X: “no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.”

The technology world has closely watched whether the Trump administration will ease recent antitrust enforcement that had seen the U.S. sue or investigate the industry’s biggest players.

Vance said the U.S. would champion American AI — which big players develop — he also said: “Our laws will keep Big Tech, little tech, and all other developers on a level playing field.”",2025-02-11T11:57:35+00:00,https://bluewaterhealthyliving.com/news/business-and-economy/vance-tells-europeans-that/,eaa87e7d06e541e79bd9da6e2d1b36e5

It will be held from February 14 to 16 at the Art of Living International Centre in Bengaluru, the official statement confirmed.

Apart from the President, other notable attendees include Karnataka Governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot, Union Minister Annapurna Devi, Minister of State Shobha Karandlaje, former Minister of State Meenakshi Lekhi, Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland, and Akie Abe, wife of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the statement added.

According to the statement, actresses Hema Malini and Sharmila Tagore, along with Bollywood icons Sara Ali Khan and Sonakshi Sinha, will also be present.

Business leaders Radhika Gupta and Kanika Tekriwal are among the distinguished participants.

The International Women’s Conference is chaired by Bhanumathi Narasimhan, the sister of Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar.

She leads women’s welfare and child care programs under The Art of Living, a non-profit organisation operating in 180 countries.

“With deep roots in spirituality and a broad vision for humanitarian service, Bhanumathi has dedicated over four decades to fostering positive social transformation through initiatives in education, environmental sustainability, and women’s empowerment,” said a statement by the organisation.

The theme of the conference is inspired by a poem by Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, called “Just Be”.

“The conference will feature deep discussions on leadership, self-discovery, and empowerment. The event will also include cultural showcases such as an International Food Festival and a musical performance, Sita Charitam,” the statement said.

This year’s conference will also have a segment called “Stylish InsideOut: Fashion for a Cause”, featuring designs from leading Indian designers like Sabyasachi, Rahul Mishra, Manish Malhotra, and Raw Mango, among others. These designs will be auctioned, and the proceeds will go towards supporting the Art of Living Free Schools.

“At a time when the world is witnessing profound shifts in leadership and gender roles, President Murmu’s presence at the International Women’s Conference underscores the significance of this transformative gathering,” the statement added.

The proceeds from the conference go toward the education of girl children.

The Art of Living Free Schools operate more than 1,300 schools across the country, having over 1 lakh students.

The statement said, “Unlike conventional leadership summits, this conference offers a holistic experience–combining intellectual discussions with spiritual practices, cultural expressions, and service-oriented social initiatives.”",2025-02-11T12:16:22+00:00,https://www.newsedge360.com/10th-international-womens-conference-president-droupadi-murmu-to-attend-art-of-living-event/,bab0661838c14d6491f2fe1ecb0570de
"Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister and Shiv Sena Chief Eknath Shinde will be honoured with the prestigious Mahadji Shinde Rashtriya Gaurav Award, presented by Pune-based Sarhad Institute.

The award ceremony will be held in New Delhi on Tuesday.

The award will be conferred upon Deputy CM Shinde by former Union Minister Sharad Pawar, who is the Chairman of the 98th All India Marathi Literary Conference and a senior NCP leader.

The event will be graced by Union Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, Union Minister of State for Cooperation and Civil Aviation Murli Dhar Mohol, senior writer Sadanand More and Padma Bhushan awardee sculptor Ram Sutar as chief guests.

The Mahadji Shinde Rashtriya Gaurav Award includes a cash prize of Rs 5 lakh, a certificate of honour, a memento, and the traditional Shindeshahi turban.

During the All India Marathi Literary Conference organised by Sarhad Institute, distinguished personalities from various fields who have made remarkable contributions in Delhi will also be felicitated.

Mahadji Shinde was a key military commander and strategist in the history of the Maratha Empire.

Born in 1730, he was the chief of the Shinde dynasty, which later became known as the Scindia dynasty of Gwalior. After the Battle of Panipat, Mahadji Shinde played a crucial role in restoring Maratha power in North India.

The Deputy CM’s office in a statement said: “During his two-and-a-half-year tenure as Chief Minister Eknath Shinde worked not as a “Chief Minister” but as a “Common Man”, making significant welfare decisions for farmers, labourers, women, senior citizens, and youth in Maharashtra. His work has been recognised at the national level, and in appreciation of his leadership, Sarhad Institute has chosen to honour him with the Mahadji Shinde Rashtriya Gaurav Award.”",2025-02-11T12:19:20+00:00,https://www.newsedge360.com/maha-dy-cm-eknath-shinde-to-be-honoured-with-mahadji-shinde-rashtriya-gaurav-award/,30f31cb7dfb945dcafec41dd744a2b29
"Kemi Badenoch has backed a UK version of Elon Musk’s US government efficiency drive, DOGE, calling for a “revolution” in the public sector.

The Conservative leader revealed she is “looking very closely” at DOGE’s slash-and-burn cost-cutting model. Asked on the Daily T podcast if Britain needs a similar initiative, Badenoch responded: “I think so.”

She added: “If you remember in my campaign launch speech, I said that we need to reboot [and] rewire the state. This is what we have to do.

“And I’m looking very closely at what they are doing in DOGE.”

Tech billionaire Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency has been the cause of significant controversy in the United States as it has foraged the federal government for savings. Critics allege a lack of transparency and argue there are no discernible limits on Musk’s influence.

Musk, the world’s richest individual, has said he wants to cut at least two trillion US dollars, one third of the US federal government’s annual budget.

So far, DOGE employees have shown up at the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Treasury Department, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, among other agencies.

Reflecting on how a national government can best lead an efficiency drive, Badenoch considered two possible approaches, including one advocated by Argentinian president Javier Milei.

She said: “You can try and make services more efficient, or you can just stop doing things, which is what they’ve done in Argentina, which is the ‘Afuera’ model, as I call it. I think that’s likely to be much more effective — where you have to think through and plan and work out, if we stop this, what’s going to happen?

“Quite often, what happens is people make an announcement, we’re going to stop this, and then there’s all sorts of knock on effects, and they panic, and then they put it back, and you realise they don’t know what they’re doing.

“The policy commission work which we’re going to be carrying out is going to do lots of deep thinking about all of this. We have to do something like DOGE — probably won’t call it that. We have to have a revolution on this, and we have to make sure that we get more people back into work, because that fixes a whole bunch of things.

“It fixes immigration, where there’s pressure to bring in lots of people to do jobs that Brits don’t necessarily want to do or cannot do because they don’t have the skills. But it also means that we’re making more money and can support better run public services.”

Badenoch also began the Conservative Party’s expectations management ahead of the upcoming local elections on 1 May.

She said: “If people are not voting Conservative because they want to give us a kicking or they want to try their luck with Reform, then we’re going to see more and more Labour.

“These are going to be extremely difficult local elections, not just because four years ago, we were at a high water mark, but because of the results in July 2024, if we had those results now, we will lose all but one council that we control. In fact, I think we might even lose that council if we repeated the July 2024 results.

“So we need to compare where we are now from where we were in July 2024 and remind people that when you vote for a local council, you’re voting for who you want to run your school, your children’s education, to take your bins, look out after your parks, fix your roads, and it’s not about giving Conservatives a kicking.”

The Conservative leader also ruled out ever signing a pact with Nigel Farage’s Reform UK, saying the party’s manifesto promises “didn’t add up”.

Badenoch told the Daily T podcast: “I am the custodian of an institution that has existed for nigh on 200 years…I can’t just treat it like it’s a toy and have pacts and mergers.”

"Transporters in Karachi have launched a protest in response to a series of incidents involving heavy vehicles being set on fire, Express News reported.

Protesters blocked major city entry points, including roads leading to Port Qasim, Hub Chowki, and New Sabzi Mandi, leading to disruptions in trafficThe transporters have demanded enhanced security measures from the government to prevent further incidents.

The unrest follows a deadly acciden earlier during the day, when a motorcyclist, 30-year-old Sadiq Ahmed, was killed in a collision with a dumper truck near Musharraf Colony in Hawks Bay. The dumper driver fled the scene, but the police have taken the vehicle into custody and are searching for the driver.

Meanwhile, two more vehicles—a water tanker and a trailer—were set on fire by unidentified individuals in separate incidents, raising the total number of vehicles torched since the morning to four. The police have initiated investigations into the fires, and authorities are working to address the growing concerns regarding public safety.

The Minister of Interior, Law, and Parliamentary Affairs, Zia-ul-Hassan Lanjhar, has taken swift action following multiple incidents in Karachi where heavy vehicles, including dumpers and tankers, were set on fire. The minister has called for a detailed report from the Additional IG Police of Karachi to investigate these incidents.

In a statement, Minister Lanjhar emphasized that any such unlawful acts will not be tolerated, reaffirming that no individual will be allowed to take the law into their own hands. He further added that protecting citizens' property is the government's responsibility, and such actions will be investigated thoroughly.

The Interior Minister also assured that the government is implementing strong measures to curb traffic accidents, with high-level committees formed to ensure the strict enforcement of traffic laws. He urged citizens to cooperate with the traffic police and abide by traffic regulations, highlighting that following the law would contribute to a prosperous and peaceful province.

Lanjhar stressed that the enforcement of laws is a key factor in the development of any society, drawing comparisons to advanced nations where law and order are the foundation of their growth.

He also directed the police to closely monitor troublemakers and ensure the consistent application of the law across the city.",2025-02-11T12:11:30+00:00,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2527894/transporters-protest-block-entry-points-after-trucks-set-on-fire-in-karachi,f81d8c54bd1c489e86243c109d348dcf

"Water bills are going up in England and Wales, even after the series of scandals around water companies. Last year water firms paid £158 million in fines following a record-breaking number of sewage dumps in rivers and seas.

Severn Trent Water and United Utilities alone reportedly made 1,374 illegal sewage spills over two years. (Both companies took issue with the analysis that led to this figure but acknowledged concerns about sewage discharges.)

There have been other notable incidents. Whistleblowers have told of water companies that fail to treat legally required amounts of sewage and divert that sewage to public waterways. To add to the disgrace, water companies have generally failed to invest enough in the UK’s water infrastructure.

Research suggests that governments have been pressured to become more “business-like”. This has given rise to the use of public-private partnerships (PPPs) to run important public services, such as water, transport and even prisons. Water companies in England and Wales are private companies that bid for their contracts, while in Scotland, the water provider is a public organisation.

While other findings show that PPPs can support important public service needs, such as public health, research by my colleagues and I examines a consistent pattern in UK PPP scandals and wrongdoing. Over the past decade and a half, billions of pounds of taxpayers’ funds are unaccounted for. This appears to be largely because private interests have been prioritised over public needs.

As a researcher of PPP wrongdoing, the reasons for many of the scandals seem obvious. My colleagues and I studied parliamentary inquiries and reports that have scrutinised PPP wrongdoing. This research can tell us a great deal about the UK’s predicament with regard to the failings in the water industry.

The first lesson is that, in general, many PPPs are motivated actually to reduce the quality of the services they deliver. One parliamentary inquiry found that contracting services out from the public to the private sector had become a “transactional process” where cost-cutting is favoured and the “knock-on cost” to users results in a lower-quality public service.

Other findings showed that companies regularly reduced the quality of a service to maximise profits. One way was to bid for a public service at a low price. A Public Accounts Committee member observed that companies coming in with low quotes for contracts can end up damaging services by under-investing in them.

Another example is Sodexo – a private prison management provider. It cut employee numbers by around 200 and a subsequent BBC Panorama documentary detailed escapes and widespread drug use in the prisons they managed and also criticised a lack of safety for both prisoners and prison officers. Sodexo acknowledged the programme had highlighted problems and said it would investigate, but added that there had been “positive actions and improvements” already.

Similar practices were observed at a children’s prison run by security firm G4S, where an officer was left with brain damage after an attack by inmates. G4S admitted liability for the officer’s injuries and agreed a settlement with him.

The second lesson is it can be cost-effective to breach contracts and pay fines. Companies sometimes breach the terms of their public-private contracts because it’s in their economic interest. This even has a name – economists call it “efficiency breach”.

For instance, a parliamentary report found that between 2010 and 2016 G4S was fined 100 times for breaching contracts – paying out roughly £3 million. As one MP suggested, these fines compared to its profits are a “slap on the wrist”. The same has been said of water companies.

When observing the fines in comparison to the profitable contracts, it’s easy to posit what the motivations of many in the UK’s public service system are. In 2017, despite previous indictments of wrongdoing, G4S won £25 million of government contracts.

In 2020 the firm won another £300 million contract to run Wellingborough “mega-prison” in England. Despite some raised eyebrows, G4S said at the time it aimed to make the site a blueprint for “innovation, rehabilitation and modernisation” in the prison service.

The third lesson is that shareholders are more important than long-term investments in a service. This is perhaps the most notable feature of the UK’s public service system, where a vast array of shareholders benefit from the profits made by PPPs. In one of the parliamentary reports we analysed, which details the collapse of the facilities management firm Carillion, it was clear that shareholders’ interests trumped good management and long-term investment.

As was noted in the report, despite Carillion’s collapse, the firm paid out £333 million more to shareholders than it generated in cash between 2012 and 2017. Often, this shareholder primacy can even go against a firm’s own employees rather than just the state and taxpayers. One MP noted that despite its pension scheme being in deficit, shareholders were still receiving dividends.

Often, shareholders are prioritised because of short-term thinking. These processes can lead to firms passing these bad practices down their supply chains.

The behaviour of water companies is suggestive of these dynamics. Since water companies have been privatised, they have loaded themselves up with debt (£64 billion) but paid out £78 billion to shareholders. Some 70% of these shareholders are “foreign investment firms, private equity, pension funds and businesses lodged in tax havens”.

So what should be done? There are plenty of ways to enhance and improve the UK’s PPP problems. The most obvious may be to renationalise public services and renew the quality of public services through New Deal-style investments. After all, this is what what most of the UK electorate wants.

There are other options. An innovative and exciting frontier is opening for businesses to recognise their environmental responsibilities – initiatives in New Zealand, India and Ecuador are giving the status of personhood to rivers and ecosystems, for example.

Outdoor fashion brand Patagonia has “the Earth” as its only shareholder, and hair and skincare brand Faith in Nature has appointed nature to its board. Imagine if the UK’s water companies had the rivers and seas represented.

In the end, only time will tell how water companies will be held accountable. But for the moment it’s the UK taxpayer and consumer paying the price.

"Astronomers have discovered another possible water world in the solar system - Uranus Ariel satellite, which is likely to hide under its surface an underground ocean with liquid water. The discovery is based on the analysis of carbon dioxide deposits, which were found in deep cracks on the satellite surface, informs Science Alert.

According to the researchers, these cracks could be formed as a result of a process similar to a spreading-a geological mechanism that occurs on Earth in the middle-ocean ridges, when the hot material rises from the depth and splits the surface. This means that Ariel's bowels could be heated as a result of the gravitational effect of Uranus, creating conditions for the existence of liquid water.

A new study confirms the hypothesis that not only Jupiter and Saturn's satellites, but also Uranus satellites can be aquatic world. However, the exact size and depth of the Surgery Ocean of Ariel remain unknown.

Further observations, in particular with the James Web Telescope, give additional evidence in favor of this theory. Scientists emphasize the need to launch a space mission to Uranus, which would help to obtain direct evidence of the existence of the underground ocean on its companions.

If this is confirmed, Ariel can become another promising candidate to find possible living conditions outside the Earth.",2025-02-11T11:16:31+00:00,https://noworries.news/naukovczi-znajshly-oznaky-isnuvannya-zhyttya-na-suputnyku-urana/,ca6f90c940f54351ab3b63af28837cb0
"Average residential conveyancing fees for freehold property transactions in early 2025 stood at £1,190.52 for sales, Property Solvers’ annual research into legal practices in England and Wales found.

For purchases, the average fee was £1,256.23, reflecting a 0.21% increase and a 0.74% decrease, respectively.

However, average conveyancing costs for leasehold property transactions saw significant growth.

Fees increased by 7.14% for sales, rising from £1,401.99 in 2024 to £1,505.80 in 2025, and by 6.16% for purchases, moving from £1,491.83 in 2024 to £1,586.65 in 2025.

Leasehold supplementary costs typically range between £250 and £600, with the seller bearing most of the financial burden.

Property Solvers also obtained remortgage conveyancing quotes based on a secured loan of £225,000, and revealed a 6.80% increase in average costs from £692.92 in 2024 to £741.67 in 2025.

The company approached 100 conveyancing firms for direct quotes, assuming a mortgage was being redeemed upon sale completion or that the property was being purchased with a mortgage.

The fees do not include additional disbursements such as telegraphic transfer charges, searches, or ID checks.

Ruban Selvanayagam of Property Solvers, said: “After rather aggressive price hikes in recent years, it would seem that conveyancing fees have stabilised to a certain degree – reflective of a somewhat more subdued inflationary landscape.

“Nonetheless, the complexity of leasehold property sales and what we see as the increased hurdles that conveyancers face when dealing with remortgages has seen an understandable increase in fees on these types of transactions.”

Selvanayagam also warned against using “suspiciously cheap” conveyancing services.

He said: “Whilst more conveyancing firms are rightfully incorporating AI and other associated efficiencies into their processes, we would generally recommend steering clear of anything below the £500 price point.

“It’s often the case that such firms are operating a conveyancing-by-numbers approach which means you’re unlikely to be offered the best level of service.”",2025-02-11T12:12:47+00:00,https://theintermediary.co.uk/2025/02/residential-conveyancing-fees-stabilise-as-leasehold-fees-rise-sharply/,a7e41543e91c4e48857e4bf1cf10f557
"If you use ChatGPT or another AI chatbot as the source of your daily news, you should expect to get wholly accurate information to only one in two of your prompts. That’s according to new research carried out in the UK by public service broadcaster the BBC, which spent over a month analysing the responses given by prominent generative AI chatbots to questions about ongoing news stories. It also found that a fifth of all answers contained clear factual errors, with over 10% including incorrectly attributed quotes to BBC articles.

The BBC carried out the research in December 2024 with a stated objective to “better understand the news related output from AI assistants”. To do so it posed news-related questions to four of the world’s biggest artificial intelligence chatbots – OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Copilot, Google’s Gemini and Perplexity – giving them access to the BBC’s own website to help them to formulate their answers. This just in! View

The responses were then reviewed by the BBC’s own journalists and subject-matter experts, who rated them for accuracy, impartiality and how they represented BBC content. They judged that 51% of the answers given by the chatbots had “significant issues of some form”, while 19% of the responses citing BBC content contained factual errors such as incorrect statements, numbers and dates.

In a press release presenting its findings, the BBC gave some examples of the most damming inaccurate answers. ChatGPT, it says, claimed that Rishi Sunak was still the Prime Minister of the UK and that Copilot claimed Nicola Sturgeon was the current First Minister of Scotland – Sunak was voted out in July, while Sturgeon had left her post 18 months earlier. Others saw Gemini misrepresent the BBC’s reportage on health advice to smokers, and Perplexity conjure up potentially emotive vocabulary in news on the Middle East that weren’t used in the original BBC stories it cited. “People may think they can trust what they’re reading from these AI assistants,” said Pete Archer, the BBC’s Programme Director for Generative AI, “but this research shows they can produce responses to questions about key news events that are distorted, factually incorrect or misleading.” “The use of AI assistants will grow so it’s critical the information they provide audiences is accurate and trustworthy.” – Pete Archer, BBC

The notion of AI going wrong is far from a new one. Last month Apple promised to improve AI news labelling after being hit with complaints about the accuracy of its AI generated news summaries. And while the BBC acknowledges that “AI is the future”, it’s using the results of its research to urge caution against the proliferation of “defective content that presents itself as fact”. “We live in troubled times, and how long will it be before an AI-distorted headline causes significant real world harm?” – Deborah Turness, BBC “We at the BBC want to open up a new conversation with AI tech providers and other leading news brands so we can work together in partnership to find solutions,” said Deborah Turness, the CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs in a further press release. “But before this conversation can begin, we needed to find out the scale of the problem with the distortion of news.” “Today we are making public that research, which shows how distortion is affecting the current generation of AI Assistants.”",2025-02-11T12:17:47+00:00,https://tech.co/news/bbc-ai-study-news-significant-issues,b87eb8815da544a9b11d39a7883a88eb

"The Rector of Kogi State Polytechnic, Lokoja, Usman Ogbo, has said that 107 security threats were prevented in the first four years of his administration.

Ogbo stated this at a press conference on Tuesday as part of activities marking the end of his first term and the start of his second four-year term.

He also highlighted some of his achievements, stating that he had succeeded in restoring the Polytechnic’s reputation among higher institutions in Nigeria.

He said, “It would be a great disservice to the Chief Servant of the state, His Excellency Ahmed Usman Ododo, if I fail to outline some of the achievements of the last four years while assuring His Excellency of our commitment to taking the Polytechnic to the next level.”

He also mentioned improvements in the guidelines for producing textbooks, including central pricing and voluntary purchase by students.

Ogbo noted that the introduction of the Academic Board Central Results Verification Committee — headed by the Deputy Rector and including Deans and representatives from each School — had significantly improved the verification process of students’ results.

“The committee carefully and thoroughly checks results submitted by Departments and Schools before making recommendations to the Academic Board for final approval.

“This process has greatly reduced errors in approved results, as the committee takes sufficient time to review them. It has also saved time and resources previously spent by the Board on result verification,” he added.

He also revealed that before his administration, the Polytechnic had never produced an annual report since its establishment.

He stated, “Shortly after we assumed office, we discovered that no annual report had ever been produced to document the Polytechnic’s past, assess its present, and plan for the future. This meant there was no single archive of records covering the institution’s activities over the years.

“This was not a good reflection on an institution that had existed for almost three decades. We, therefore, took it as a challenge to ensure that the activities of each academic session are documented in an annual report.”

He stated that the first-ever annual report for the Polytechnic was produced for the 2018/2019 session, making history for the institution.

“The production of annual reports has now become a tradition. We have already completed the 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 editions, and we are now in the final stages of producing the 2021/2022, 2022/2023, and 2023/2024 editions.”",2025-02-11T11:54:12+00:00,https://punchng.com/kogi-poly-foils-107-security-threats-in-four-years-rector/,ce08ebcd6ab54bf1954b3bdaba3fba7c

"With an eye towards LDC graduation, an inter-ministerial committee has been formed by the finance ministry to formulate an action plan to increase export capacity of leather and leather products, jute products, agricultural and processed agricultural products and pharmaceutical sectors.

A platform will also be outlined to promote potential export sectors.

The committee will determine what kind of support is needed to increase the export capacity of other major export sectors besides ready-made garments, in addition to cash incentives.

Speaking to The Business Standard, FBCCI Administrator and former director general of the WTO Cell of the Ministry of Commerce Md Hafizur Rahman said despite taking various initiatives to diversify exports for many years, no committee has worked specifically on these potential sectors.

Therefore, the initiative to provide special incentives to these potential sectors by forming such a committee before LDC graduation is a very timely decision.

He said the rate of cash incentives in ready-made garment exports is very low and LDC graduation will not have much impact on it.

""Because, the GSP facility will be available in the main market European Union until 2029, after which GSP Plus will be available,"" he said.

""The rate of cash support against exports of leather and leather products, jute products, agricultural and processed agricultural products and pharmaceutical sector products is very high. There is cash support of up to 15% in some sectors. If alternative incentives are not provided for these sectors, there is a risk of negative impact on the exports of the sectors after LDC graduation in 2026. Therefore, the initiative to maintain the export capacity of these potential sectors as well as increase their capacity is commendable,"" he said.

The committee has been formed with an additional secretary of the Finance Ministry as the chairman and has representatives from the Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Industries, Bangladesh Bank, National Board of Revenue, Bangladesh Investment Development Authority, Bangladesh Trade and Tariff Commission, Export Promotion Bureau and FBCCI.

The committee will submit a partial report by 25 February.

This committee will identify the obstacles to increasing the export capacity of the potential sectors and recommend to the government what kind of financial and non-financial policy support can be provided.

It will also determine what kind of problems the sectors will face if export incentives are stopped after Bangladesh graduates from LDC in 2026 and ways to overcome those problems.

A member of the committee, requesting anonymity, told TBS that cash support for each sector was reduced during the preparation of the budget for the last fiscal year.

According to the decision of the Awami League government, there was a plan to completely withdraw cash support in the budget.

He said various studies had shown that exports will be affected if cash assistance is stopped after LDC graduation, and to address this, it has been recommended to provide alternative incentives, including subsidies on electricity bills.

But in reality, no specific decision has been made on what benefits the government will provide.

Therefore, an initiative has been taken to finalise an action plan in this regard before the next budget.",2025-02-11T12:15:00+00:00,https://www.tbsnews.net/economy/committee-formed-formulate-action-plan-increase-export-capacity-different-sectors-1066586,3b11d5c33d914ccda777ebcffb498e35
"Head of the Metropolitan Police Sir Mark Rowley said it is “absurd” that officers who are not fit to hold vetting cannot be lawfully sacked.

Sergeant Lino Di Maria successfully mounted a legal challenge, supported by the Metropolitan Police Federation, after having his vetting removed over sexual assault allegations, which he denies.

He was found to have no case to answer in respect of misconduct allegations, and argued that having his vetting removed without the accusations being proved is a breach of his right to a fair trial.

Sir Mark said: “Today’s ruling on the law has left policing in a hopeless position.

“We now have no mechanism to rid the Met of officers who were not fit to hold vetting – those who cannot be trusted to work with women, or those who cannot be trusted to enter the homes of vulnerable people.

“It is absolutely absurd that we cannot lawfully sack them.

“This would not be the case in other sectors where staff have nothing like the powers comparable to police officers.”

He called on the Government to take action to urgently change the rules around officers’ vetting.

Reacting to the ruling on Tuesday by Mrs Justice Lang, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: “This decision has significant implications for the work the Met is now doing to clean up the force, raise standards and rid the police of all those unfit to serve.

“I have long been clear that there can be no hiding place for those who abuse their position of trust and authority within the police.

“Working alongside the Met Commissioner, I want no let-up in the vital work being carried out to raise standards and rebuild public confidence in the Met.

“No-one who has failed vetting should continue to serve in the force and we will work closely with the commissioner, the Home Office and partners to assess the implications of this ruling.”",2025-02-11T12:13:07+00:00,https://www.falmouthpacket.co.uk/news/national/24926289.absurd-met-police-cannot-sack-officers-not-fit-hold-vetting---commissioner/,10b077e9c2e84bc7ae0ae3e66f3839ac

"A café and bakery in Dublin city centre was ordered to close after food safety inspectors discovered an active cockroach infestation in the premises, finding insect eggs next to uncovered mashed potatoes.

Ella’s Heaven on Talbot Street was one of five businesses ordered to close part or all of their operations by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) last month following serious breaches of food safety legislation.

Inspectors found cockroaches at all stages of their lifecycle “from nymph to adult” in the coffee shop and bakery, with live insects spotted “directly above” open food and spices.

Balam Limited, a food business located at 114 Boyne Road, Dublin Industrial Estate, Glasnevin, Dublin 11, was also ordered to close after FSAI inspectors found that a “dirty bed sheet” was being used to cover and store unpacked tortillas.

They also reported that there was a scooter and a gazebo in the food production area, along with “many shoes”, a screwdriver, and “an abundance” of obsolete equipment.

There was a “complete lack of cleaning” at the premises, no sanitiser was available, and there were unwashed clothes throughout the building. The FSAI made the decision to close the business citing “a grave and immediate danger to public health”.

Elsewhere, the restaurant at Lismore Golf Club in Waterford was ordered to close last month after rat droppings were discovered in a kitchen cupboard, which inspectors said posed a serious risk of food contamination.

The Turk Grill takeaway at 23 Grattan Street, Sligo was also closed after the FSAI raised concerns about a lack of handwashing by food handlers, and a “large hole” in the wall of a staff changing area, which could result in the infestation of pests.

The Miner’s Rest Public House in Ballingary, Tipperary was ordered to close an external drinks storage room after inspectors found rodent faeces on the floor near bottled alcoholic drinks that were not protected against contamination.

The historic Bewley’s Café on Grafton Street was ordered to cease using a vacuum-packing machine, which was being used for both raw fish and ready-to-eat foods like egg mayonnaise. This presented a significant risk of foods being contaminated with bacteria, FSAI inspectors noted.

Indian Tiffins restaurant at 143 Parnell Street, Dublin 1 was ordered to close by the authority on the basis that there was “no evidence that the management system for food safety, which had been in place previously, had been fully implemented and maintained”.

Xpress Pantry at Unit 9, Dunshaughlin Business Park in Meath was ordered to cease the manufacture and wholesale of foods of animal origin, as the FSAI said the establishment had not been approved by a competent authority for the operations taking place.

In total, 11 enforcement orders were served on food businesses by the FSAI during January. Dr Pamela Byrne, the CEO of the authority, said the legal onus is on businesses to ensure they comply with food safety legislation.

“Food businesses have a fundamental legal responsibility to ensure the food they produce is safe to eat,” she said.

“The enforcement orders served in January highlight unacceptable breaches of food safety legislation, including inadequate pest control, poor hygiene standards, and a lack of proper food traceability.

“These non-compliances pose a serious risk to consumer health and also undermine confidence in the food industry,” added Dr Byrne.

“It is essential that all food businesses implement and maintain a robust food safety management system to prevent such violations. The law is clear, food safety is not optional, and food businesses that fail to comply will face enforcement action.”

"DHAKA: Bangladesh’s powerful BNP political party has spoken out publicly for the first time against the interim government after a surge of unrest and a sweeping security crackdown.

Police have arrested more than 1,500 people nationwide since Saturday as part of “Operation Devil Hunt”, targeting groups allegedly connected to ousted premier Sheikh Hasina, who was toppled in a student-led revolution in August.

Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, Bangladesh National Party secretary-general, met interim leader Mohammed Yunus late on Monday to “raise concerns over the incidents that have swept across the country”.

Protesters smashed buildings connected to Hasina’s family using excavators – including a museum to her late father, Bangladesh’s first president – on February 5, six months to the day since she fled as crowds stormed her palace in Dhaka.

Police stood by as protesters torched the building.

“It all happened in front of law enforcement agencies, so the government cannot avoid its responsibility,” Alamgir said.

Those protests followed reports that 77-year-old Hasina, who has defied an arrest warrant to face trial for crimes against humanity, would appear in a live broadcast from exile in neighbouring India.

There were also clashes between anti-Hasina protesters and members of her Awami League party.

Members of the Students Against Discrimination protest group were attacked in the Dhaka district of Gazipur on Friday. The group, whose members are now in the government cabinet, is credited with sparking the uprising against Hasina.

The vocal and powerful group then demanded action, sparking the security operation with mass arrests countrywide.

“We have seen such drives before,” Alamgir said. “We cautioned the government to protect innocent civilians.”

Human Rights Watch warned last month that the police had “returned to the abusive practices that characterized the previous government”.

Yunus, 84, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, has warned against retaliation after Hasina’s ouster.

“The sacrifices we made were aimed at bringing an end to injustices across all sectors,” Yunus said late on Monday.

“If we engage in the same kind of actions as the fallen regime, there will be no difference between them and us,” he said.

Also on Monday, police took publisher Shatabdi Bhaba into protective custody after dozens of furious Islamist students swarmed his stall at Dhaka’s Ekushey Book Fair.

“They had been campaigning to vandalize the book stall,” said Sanjana Mehran, co-founder with Bhaba of Sabyasachi Publishers, saying the chanting protesters were angry over a book by exiled feminist author Taslima Nasrin.

Yunus said that such “unwarranted acts undermine the inclusive cultural traditions” of Bangladesh.",2025-02-11T12:18:46+00:00,https://www.brecorder.com/news/40347424/key-bangladesh-party-warns-over-unrest-after-buildings-smashed,c23a892bb5a04f98a53f90b276bea9e2

"For centuries, humans have shaped the traits of domesticated animals to meet their needs. From larger cows producing more milk to dogs bred for specific temperaments, selective breeding has transformed species in remarkable ways. Recent research on German pigs has revealed just how quickly these changes can occur.

A team from Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU) has found that German domestic pigs have experienced dramatic skull modifications within a century.

Their snouts have shortened, and their foreheads have flattened, traits that were not intentionally selected. The findings provide fresh insight into the unintended consequences of breeding practices.

Pigs have been an essential part of human agriculture for thousands of years. Over time, their appearance has shifted significantly, influenced by both natural and human-driven factors.

In Germany, the early 20th century marked a turning point in pig breeding, as demand for pork increased dramatically. Farmers prioritized traits such as rapid growth, high fertility, and efficient meat production.

“The demand for pork in Germany increased significantly at the beginning of the 20th century, and breeders were encouraged to optimize their animals. They needed them to grow quickly, provide good meat, and be fertile,” explained Dr. Renate Schafberg, Head of the Domestic Animal Collection at MLU.

To understand the impact of these breeding efforts, Dr. Schafberg worked with Dr. Ashleigh Haruda from Oxford University to analyze 135 pig skulls from different time periods.

The study included two domestic breeds – Deutsches Edelschwein and Deutsches Landschwein – as well as wild boars, which served as a control group. The results revealed a striking transformation in domestic pigs, while wild boars showed no comparable changes.

One of the most significant findings of the study was the extent of skull changes in domesticated pigs. Their snouts became notably shorter, and their foreheads lost their outward curve. These modifications occurred in both domestic breeds, despite the fact that they were raised separately.

“We didn’t expect such pronounced differences to appear within a span of only 100 years,” said Dr. Schafberg. The fact that both breeds experienced similar changes suggests that the modifications were not the result of direct selection for skull shape.

“These changes occurred even though breeders did not select the animals specifically for their skull shape, as this trait was not important for breeding. Instead, the changes appear to be an unintended by-product of selecting the desired traits,” noted Dr. Schafberg.

This discovery highlights how the pursuit of specific breeding goals can lead to unforeseen alterations in an animal’s physical structure.

While breeding practices played a major role in shaping the skulls of domestic pigs, another factor may have contributed: diet.

Nutrition is a key influence on the growth and development of animals. Modern pigs are primarily fed high-protein pellets designed to support rapid growth and efficient meat production.

By contrast, wild boars continue to consume a varied diet, including roots, nuts, and small animals. Their skulls have remained unchanged over the past century, suggesting that their natural feeding habits have helped maintain their original features.

The study raises intriguing questions about the relationship between diet and physical evolution in domesticated animals.

The findings demonstrate the remarkable speed at which human intervention can shape animal species. While many assume that significant evolutionary changes take millions of years, selective breeding can accelerate these processes dramatically.

“Charles Darwin assumed that long periods of time – millions of years – are required for major changes to take place. Our work is further proof that humans can greatly accelerate this process through selective breeding,” said co-author Dr. Frank Steinheimer, Head of the Central Repository of Natural Science Collections at MLU.

These insights have broader implications for agriculture and animal husbandry. As selective breeding continues to shape domesticated animals, researchers must consider the potential consequences, both intended and unintended.

The study serves as a reminder that even small changes in breeding practices can have lasting effects on animal physiology.

Pig breeding may continue in the future

As the global demand for meat continues to grow, breeding practices will likely continue to evolve. Understanding how these methods impact animal development is crucial for ensuring sustainable and ethical farming.

Scientists will need to explore the long-term effects of breeding choices, considering not only productivity but also the health and well-being of animals.

The study was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the European Research Council (ERC).

The research offers a compelling look at the complex relationship between human influence and animal evolution, shedding light on the ways in which farming practices shape the very biology of domesticated species.

The study is published in the journal Royal Society Open Science.

"Apple continues to expand its smartphone line, and this year the company will introduce five new iPhone models at once. Each of them has already managed to appear on the network.

What is known about future iPhone from Apple in 2025

The biggest change is the rejection of the home button in favor of the display, which occupies the entire front panel. The new SE will also receive several flagship characteristics of the iPhone 16, including:

In addition, the iPhone SE 4 is expected to be the first Apple model with its own 5G modem, which will make it even more attractive budget.

This fall Apple will release four iPhone 17 models. Instead of iPhone Plus, the company will introduce the iPhone 17 Air, which will become the most revolutionary model in the line.

The main focus is on the design-an ultra-thin case and a new display format, which is located between the size of Pro models.

The characteristics of the iPhone 17 Air will be similar to the base iPhone 17, but it will be different:

This model is expected to be one of the most stylish and original in recent years.

The iPhone 17 Pro will save a 6.3 -inch display like 16 Pro but will get some changes:

Apple will also improve selfies-the entire iPhone 17 series will receive a 24MP front camera instead of 12MP.

As always, Pro Max will receive all the benefits of iPhone 17 Pro, but with bonuses, such as a larger battery.

The main intrigue is the smaller Dynamic Island. There is an assumption that this is a hint of Face ID built into the display, although other sources refute this information.

Exclusive benefits in the camera are also possible, but there are no specific rumors about it.

The iPhone 16 has become one of the best basic iPhone in recent years, and the successor has every chance of repeating success. Expected characteristics are as follows:

Given competition within the line (especially with the iPhone 17 Air and SE 4), Apple will have to make the base model even more attractive.

Recall Apple will announce the new budget smartphone of the iPhone SE this week. Earlier it was expected that the novelty would be represented in March or April.

We also wrote that Apple is actively developing the first compound iPhone. It will resemble the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold, and the novelty can appear in September 2026.",2025-02-11T11:52:13+00:00,https://novyny.live/tehnologii/apple-anonsuie-piat-novikh-iphone-shcho-ochikuvati-u-2025-rotsi-232846.html,b38b6ce54d9346efa4d3cd0b3b9c5f24
"Syed Noor on his first love, second marriage and much more

"It was a weird Super Bowl for Jason Kelce in so many ways.

He was rooting for both his brother Travis Kelce and his former team, the Philadelphia Eagles. No matter which side won, he had to be sad for one and happy for the other.

And that was his message in a massive post on X (formerly Twitter).

""That game was odd for me to watch if I’m being completely honest,"" he began. ""I knew it was going to be mixed emotions before, during, and after, and I now know what my parents had to deal with two years ago.""

He went on to talk about how proud he was of the Eagles and their players. But then he got to Travis.

""As for my brother, There isn’t a person I love or care about more,"" he wrote. ""It has been tough to process these feelings, of course I feel for him and am always rooting for him, but I know he does not need, nor want my pity. He has amassed greatness few on this planet could ever dream of, as has his team, and they should feel pride in their accomplishments this season and in the past.""

From education to farmland: Here's Gov. Lee's priorities for Tennessee in 2025

In his State of the State address on Monday night, Gov. Bill Lee announced more money for public education, transportation and conservation efforts in Tennessee.

The governor's proposed budget — in his second to last — totals $59.4 billion. That money will fund schools, roads, higher education and all state departments.

"Ex-Delhi Police Commissioner Ajay Raj Sharma, Who Laid Foundation Of Uttar Pradesh STF, Passes Away In Noida

New Delhi/Noida: IPS officer Ajay Raj Sharma, who was known as the backbone of the Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force (STF), breathed his last on Tuesday at Kailash Hospital in Noida. He was 80. His last rites will be performed with state honours at Lodhi Garden in Delhi on Wednesday. Sharma, a 1966-batch IPS officer had laid the foundation of Uttar Pradesh STF and also served as the Delhi Police Commissioner. It was Sharma who had first started encounters in Uttar Pradesh.

After this, an STF was formed under his leadership to nab the miscreant who took contract to kill the then Chief Minister Kalyan Singh.

Prakash Shukla was killed in the encounter with STF in Ghaziabad. In those days, Prakash Shukla was a terror for the common people and was known for committing crimes in broad daylight. His elimination had brought the much-needed relief to the police department. Known as an honest police officer, Sharma was considered to be very adept in controlling criminals.

"Singer Alesha Dixon has revealed that she is working “super hard” to prevent her children from having smartphones.

The British star, 46, who shares children Azura and Anaya with British-born Nigerian artist Azuka Ononye, is returning to ITV show Britain’s Got Talent as a judge this month.

Dixon told Women’s Health UK: “As long as we can avoid our daughters having phones, we’re going try our hardest. (Azura, 11) can be begging me for a mobile phone and I feel no way to be like ‘nope’ because I’ve got one.

“(But) you’ve got to be strong with it. My thing is this: if she doesn’t need a phone then why is she having one?

“If I can delay her being in that world, I’m going to work super hard to make sure that it doesn’t happen. I don’t care if her friends have got phones. In our house, we don’t want that.”

The issue was recently explore in the Channel 4 documentary Swiped: The School That Banned Smartphones, fronted by married TV presenters Emma and Matt Willis.

It found that the sleep and behaviour of pupils improved thanks to giving up their smartphones.

The Conservative Party has pushed for the Government to ban phones in classrooms.

The Government is conducting research in the area, led by the University of Cambridge, into the impact of social media on children’s overall wellbeing.

As Dixon is a cover star of Women’s Health UK’s March issue, she also spoke about how she would like to return to the 2000s, where you “can rave”, and be “on the mic” without it being all over social media.

She said: “It’s fine, but you just want to be in the moment – and then it’s on Instagram stories.”

Dixon also said that in some ways things are easier for young artists because of social media, as “now an artist can do one interview and seed it out to the world”.

“Back then, you’d have to go to every single radio station, you’d have to do every TV show, which is why we never had a life,” she added.

During 2024’s semi-final of Britain’s Got Talent, she performed a mash-up of tracks including Scandalous from her former girl band Mis-Teeq, her 2008 solo hit The Boy Does Nothing and her new song titled Ransom – her first track in nine years.

She recalled that she “felt so alive”, and “at home, surrounded by everybody that I know and love” on stage.

“I got to perform, which is my first love, and it was just such a beautiful moment for me,” Dixon said.

“I just thought, ‘Oh my God, I’ve missed performing so much.’ And I did say to myself after that performance…’Girl, you need to get back on stage more because that’s what makes you feel alive’.”

The star, born in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, quit Mis-Teeq, also known for the hit Why?, before pursuing a solo career in 2005.

In 2007, she appeared on Strictly Come Dancing and ultimately lifted the Glitterball trophy before becoming a judge on the BBC show, presenting talent show The Greatest Dancer, and the 2023 Eurovision Song Contest in Liverpool.

"When we interact with large language models such as ChatGPT or DALL-E, those algorithms generate responses based on our text inputs, not us as people. As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to permeate everyday life, new questions about human identity and interaction begin to form. What matters more: who we are as people, or the collection of data that make up our digital self?

The broader theme of digital vs. physical identity in an increasingly AI-infused world is the topic of “A[fter] I: Algorithmic Identities,” the 2025 wintersession residency for Conflux, an art-technology collaboration student organization sponsored by the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. This year’s residency, the third since Conflux formed during the 2022-23 school year, featured seven installations at the FAS CAMLab Cave that used technology to expand on artistic and philosophical ideas about how identity has changed in the wake of AI. Located in Cambridge, the CAMLab Cave is an installation site for digital, immersive and multimedia art projects.

“I got really excited by the idea that I could use all the technical skills I’d developed over the last few years to express my own ideas and feelings, and to create an experience for other people,” said resident Kevin Yang, a first-year student studying mechanical engineering and philosophy. “Creating an interactive experience that can instill some sort of feeling into attendees as they move through this space is something I’m drawn to.”

Yang’s project, Cosmic Imprints, sought to transform individual identity into a sense of global connection. By scanning a QR code, visitors were taken to a website that scanned their palm. Those scans were then converted into topographical segments, the natural ridges and lines in the palm becoming mountains and valleys. Once enough scans were collected, they were combined into a digital planet, which was then projected onto a wall in the CAMLab Cave. Yang and co-creator Fadil Cantave, an MIT graduate student, also brought 3D-printed versions of previous palm scans, each one converted to look like topographic regions.

“We wanted to highlight the unique individual experiences that we all have, and then deliver them in an interesting form of visualization,” Yang said. “And then we wanted to create a sublime collective feeling from all these unique individual experiences.”",2025-02-11T12:00:00+00:00,https://seas.harvard.edu/news/2025/02/identity-digital-age,12884a96badf462997f4d2cac4e67e06

"If you think about the FC Barcelona attack, there are three key names that form a lethal trident that makes the number of goals scored by the Catalans a record. Between Raphinha, Lewandowski and Lamine they have scored 65 of the 113 goals that the team has scored so far this season. If we limit it to LaLiga alone, the three of them have scored 36 of the team’s 63 goals.

Specifically, Raphinha, who found the net at the Sánchez Pizjuán, has 24 goals and 15 assists in 35 games. In total, the Barça number 11 has scored 13 goals in 23 LaLiga games, 8 in 8 Champions League games, 2 in 2 Spanish Super Cup games and 1 in the Copa del Rey. The 28-year-old footballer is having one of his best seasons and has become a key player in Hansi Flick’s scheme of things. That is why, according to Sport, Barça have already made moves to renew him.

The footballer still has a valid contract, specifically his link with FC Barcelona extends until 2027, but the club does not want to take risks with one of its key players. Raphinha will be 30 years old when his contract ends, but the club is already making moves to secure his future.

According to the aforementioned source, the proposal being prepared by the sporting management is to offer him two more seasons, until 2029, and a salary increase from 2026.

They say that comparisons are odious, but, without a doubt, comparing the numbers of the Barça player with a candidate for the Ballon d’Or serves to show the magnitude of the season he is having. Raphinha has already matched the statistics that made Vinicius one of the top candidates to win the coveted award last season. In the end, Rodri took it despite the fact that the Brazilian winger’s figures included 25 goals and 12 assists in 40 games played, so with 24 goals already to his name and half a season still to play, the Barca player aims to beat the Real player’s record.",2025-02-11T12:14:32+00:00,https://www.grada3.com/us/2025/02/11/fc-barcelona-already-working-to-keep-raphinha/,918d5c895eb1477c95cbf985eb4f91fc

"Square Chapel was named an National Portfolio Organisation in 2022, just two years after falling into administration.

A Halifax theatre that receives funding from Arts Council England (ACE) as part of the National Portfolio has announced that it is closing its doors while it considers the future of the venue.

Square Chapel CIC said in a statement that all future events at the venue have been cancelled until a decision is made. It confirmed that it will directly contact any creditors and debtors and that anyone with tickets for upcoming performances will be automatically refunded.

A spokesperson from ACE, which funds Square Chapel to the tune of £159,000 a year, told the Halifax Courier: “We’re aware that Square Chapel has been facing financial challenges.

“We are in contact with the directors while they investigate the options open to them.”

Calderdale Council provided Square Chapel with £70,000 per year from 2019 until 2022, but has ruled out support for the struggling theatre.

Councillor Danielle Durrans said that although Square Chapel is popular and has been valuable in showcasing local talent, it is not a council-owned building.

“Unfortunately it is not possible for us to contribute to it financially as we are having to spend our limited budget very carefully and make difficult decisions across a range of services,” said Durrans.

“We are in contact with [ACE] and will explore all possibilities for the future of the venue.”

Six months ago, ACE resumed payments to Square Chapel after temporarily halting them amid concerns that some performers who had played at the venue had not been paid.

ACE said that it took action after the art centre’s directors “failed to provide adequate information” to satisfy the conditions of its National Portfolio funding agreement.

Following the receipt of evidence, ACE said it restarted the instalments but noted that any further payments would only be approved “on a case-by-case basis on receipt of satisfactory monitoring information”.

A spokesperson for Square Chapel said at the time that several factors contributed to its cash flow problems, including Calderdale Council withdrawing its funding and redundancies at a related organisation, The Old Courts, which affected staff capacity and expertise.

They said that the process of having its ACE funding paused had been “incredibly frustrating” and that it had accrued “a significant number of priority and artist debts” during that time.

They said, “If we’d have known that our funding was at risk of being frozen for such a long time, there’s no way we’d have made commitments to artists.

“We believed that the [situation] would be quickly resolved, which is why we continued to trade.

“We pride ourselves on looking after artists, and not being able to pay them on time has been a massive blow to everyone.”

Square Chapel was named an National Portfolio Organisation in 2022, just two years after falling into administration.

In September 2020, the venue was saved from closure when it was taken over by Arts at the Mill, an umbrella company for Wigan organisations The Old Courts, Wigan Pier, and The Royal Court Theatre, a move supported by ACE and Calderdale Council.

Square Chapel is the second Arts at the Mill organisation to have its NPO funding paused. In October 2023, The Old Courts had its payments temporarily frozen after it lost around £1.2m in revenue when structural damage to its concrete floor resulted in temporary closure.

An investigation conducted last year by Arts Professional and MyCake, a financial benchmarking company, found that the arts organisations in the 2023-26 National Portfolio were collectively in the red by £63.1m in 2023.

During the current portfolio period the total number of NPOs has dropped by five. The Great Literary Agency announced last month that it would close at the end of March, while Derby-based dance company Déda entered liquidation in August 2024, and Studio 3 Arts, which was based in Barking, went into liquidation in December 2023.

Beacon Collaborative has also left the 2023-26 portfolio, while Poet in the City closed as a separate charity, merging its activities with Apples & Snakes.",2025-02-11T12:14:26+00:00,https://www.artsprofessional.co.uk/news/ace-funded-theatre-cancels-all-events-amid-uncertain-future,a359efed97fa468eb5c3846b7530bab6
"Lausanne: The inaugural Olympic Esports Games will take place in Riyadh in 2027, two years later than originally planned, following a 12-year agreement with Saudi Arabia signed last year. The qualifying period, the Road to the Olympic Esports Games, will start this year, the International Olympic Committee said on Tuesday.

In June 2024, the IOC Executive Board announced that it would create an Olympic Esports Games, with the 142nd IOC Session held during the 2024 Summer Olympics due to vote on the proposal.

In July 2024, it was announced that the inaugural Olympic Esports Games would be held in Saudi Arabia in 2025, following a new partnership with the Saudi Arabian Olympic Committee. The proposal was ultimately approved by a unanimous vote on July 23, 2024.

For the organisation of the Olympic Esports Games, IOC is partnering with the Saudi Olympic and Paralympic Committee. The Esports World Cup Foundation (EWCF) will become the founding partner of the Games.

""The IOC and EWCF will collaborate closely with key stakeholders to establish qualification pathways, enhance competitive integrity, and align the national esports ecosystems with broader global standards,"" the IOC said in a release.

"She will lead the organisation after Carol Main, who had been director since 1984, stepped down

Live Music Now Scotland, one of the country’s leading music charities working in schools, hospitals, care homes and hospices, has announced the appointment of Judith Anderson as its new CEO.

She will lead the organisation after Carol Main, who had been director since its foundation in 1984, stepped down.

Judith will take the charity into its next phase, bringing her extensive experience in both music and the wider arts sectors.

The group said she has a proven track record of managing charitable arts organisations with a strong social purpose.

The appointment coincides with the organisation receiving funding from both Creative Scotland’s Multi-Year Funding and the award of £150,000 from the Elizabeth Lornie’s Charitable Trust.

This significant milestone will enable Live Music Now Scotland to continue its mission of making high-quality live music accessible to all, especially those who normally wouldn’t have access to it.

Carol Main, who led the organisation since it was founded in Edinburgh in 1984, said: “After 40 years working with Live Music Now Scotland, building it from Yehudi Menuhin’s request to start his unique scheme in Scotland into a thriving organisation which puts on over 750 events throughout the country each year, while simultaneously supporting 135 musicians, it’s now time for me to take a step back.

“In Judith’s appointment, I am confident that our exceptional early career artists and wide range of audiences will all continue to be supported. I honestly couldn’t have wished for anyone more suited to the role of taking Live Music Now Scotland into its next 40 years”.

Amanda Forsyth, chair of the Board of Trustees, added: ""The board is absolutely delighted to have secured Judith for the role of chief executive of Live Music Now Scotland. Her wide-ranging experience in the arts in Scotland will stand us in good stead as we face the challenges ahead, and we look forward to working with her.""

Judith joins Live Music Now Scotland from the position of head of development and operations at Starcatchers, Scotland's national arts and early years organisation.

Her leadership experience spans multiple sectors, working collaboratively to achieve social impact through the arts. She has worked with many of Scotland’s leading classical, folk, and contemporary musicians, creating new performances and tours, as well as collaborating with music organisations such as Lammermuir Festival, Mr McFall’s Chamber, and Scottish Ensemble.

A graduate of the Royal Northern College of Music and an avid saxophonist, Judith has long supported musicians at all stages of their professional development. She has also served as a guest lecturer in Professional Skills at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, further cementing her deep commitment to the growth of both artists and arts organisations.

She said: “I’m thrilled and honoured to step into the role of chief executive for Live Music Now Scotland.

“It’s a privilege to join an organisation with such an inspiring legacy, especially as we celebrate 40 years under the direction of Carol Main, our outgoing director. I’m excited about the challenges ahead and look forward to working with exceptional musicians and partners to ensure that great live music experiences continue to connect with people in ways that are inclusive, meaningful and joyful.”",2025-02-11T12:12:14+00:00,https://tfn.scot/news/new-chief-for-leading-music-charity,9154342fda804a4a9f0a74152fc773fa

"It’s a love story like no other. Two elite snipers, from opposite sides of the globe, begin to fall for each other across a bottomless chasm – one that’s filled with an unknown entity which governments are working to hide from the rest of the world.

When Levi and Drasa, played by Whiplash star Miles Teller and The Queen’s Gambit and Furiosa’s Anya Taylor-Joy respectively, accept their missions to defend a gorge filled with eternal fog, they have no idea what’s in store for them. They’re guarding a chasm from a mysterious threat, and are posted in solitude in watchtowers on either side of the terrifying pit.

The Gorge, which also stars Sigourney Weaver, charts the horrors and joys that unfold as they guard the chasm, and whatever lies inside it, while forging an unlikely connection through handwritten signs from opposing sides of the abyss.

“It was an original idea. It was a pretty high concept piece, the movie felt big to me…” says Miles Teller, 37.

“Two snipers falling in love. Two snipers who are sent on missions where they’re to have no contact with anybody. They’ll be there for a year in complete isolation, but there’s someone across the way in the same situation, and they start to fall for somebody through their sniper scope.”

“There’s something about the two characters and their love story that I just thought was so believable,” adds Taylor-Joy, 28.

“I just really rooted for these two people, and I had confidence that Miles and I could pull that off.”

“We are simpatico for the entire film, and so much of the performance relies on what you’re getting from that other person. I knew that with Anya it would be a really wonderful experience.”

The Gorge blends character drama with romance, action with horror in a “genre bending” tale that’s truly “exciting”, Taylor-Joy says.

“I love that this film begins as one thing, then there’s a middle section that’s an entirely different thing, and then we finish it in an entirely different world. That felt like something exciting to me,” says the star.

As such, there’s a lot for us to sink our teeth into, from the mystery of what lies in the chasm between Levi and Drasa to the backstories that led these characters to this bleak, isolated mission that’s fraught with danger and combat.

“She is such a fascinating person for me, because it feels like she has a very strong delineation between what she does for a living and then her real life,” says Taylor-Joy of Drasa, the Lithuanian sniper who loves punk music and has an intriguing family backstory.

“I think that comes from her relationship with her father: She’s always felt like she’s had somebody that she could be completely honest with, and she’s also just incredibly comfortable in her own skin.”

To get into the character, Taylor-Joy – whose varied filmography includes Split, The Menu, Emma and The Super Mario Bros. Movie – says she imagined Drasa’s past and how she ended up in this position: “What was she like as a teenager? What punk shows did she go to? Who were her circle of friends? And at what point did she decide: ‘Yeah, I’m actually kind of OK being on my own’?”

Teller, on the other hand, leaned into his real life, in particular the military experiences of his close friends, as he delved into the hardened U.S. Marine sniper Levi.

“A lot of my close friends are in the military, or were at some point, so I’ve always had a connection to that world through friendship,” the Top Gun: Maverick star explains.

“It’s tough for these guys, and they talk about it: When they’re at war, they want to go home, and then they’re home and they feel out of place, and they feel like they need to go back to war.

“So I think just making sure the duality is existing (is important).”

Levi is also what Teller calls a “warrior poet”, who uses poetry as an outlet for the horrors he’s experienced in his military career.

“Because we know, unfortunately, so many of these guys kill themselves from PTSD. I think there’s 22 veterans a day that take their own life. So I thought it was beautiful that this film wasn’t afraid to explore somebody who can be a sniper, somebody who can be a highly decorated combat personnel, but then also feels comfortable enough with themselves to share that they enjoy poetry, that they write poetry,” he says.

On top of this dense character narrative, The Gorge is also a thrill ride with action, horror, and sci-fi elements. As such, its stars had to be ready to fight, to handle sniper rifles, to portray the physical might of their hardened characters.

“I think I was quite lucky, because I’d just come from Furiosa, so I was like, battle ready. I am currently not as battle ready right now!” laughs Taylor-Joy.

“It was such a part of the characters that it felt like a great way to get to know them as well, and we had a lot of fun with it.”

“I think Anya and I, we really leaned into the action portions of this, because (of) the nature of their characters…” adds Teller.

“It wasn’t just the action and the beats, but making sure that we maintain that storyline with the characters. A lot of the film was very practical, and we actually didn’t use a ton of green screen for this. A lot of those sets we built, and I think that always helps.”

Filmed in part at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden, The Gorge made use of enormous film sets that Teller says made the stars “instantly feel like you’re in an action movie, a big action movie”.

“The practical locations – I got to go to Norway, that was stunning – it gives something really (tactile) to go off of,” he adds.

“And they were big spaces in Leavesden at the studio, you never felt confined.”

“These sets felt huge,” agrees Taylor-Joy, who even shot an “extraordinary” forest scene featuring “20 real horses running left, right and centre” on a set in the studio.

“Every single time when you walked into it, you didn’t want to leave, because it was just fun to hang out in there.”

"In January, 2025, BOOM published 89 fact-checks in English, Hindi and Bangla.

We published 21 fact-checks addressing AI-generated claims, marking the highest number of AI-related fact-checks in a single month to date. This is a significant increase from our previous record of 12 AI-related fact-checks.

These fact-checks covered topics such as the Maha Kumbh, the wildfires in Los Angeles, the Delhi Assembly elections, and more.

The Muslim community in India was the main target of misinformation, comprising 14.6% of all false claims. This was followed by claims directed at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. We also published 21 fact-checks addressing AI-generated claims, covering topics such as the wildfires in Los Angeles (5 fact-checks), the Maha Kumbh (4 fact-checks), the Delhi Assembly elections, and more. 41.5% out of the total fact-checks involved claims that were shared by verified accounts on X. Misinformation in 37.1% of the total fact-checks were peddled using old and unrelated videos. These mainly include Islamophobic claims specifically targeting the Muslim community, as well as false or fake claims directed at social media content creators and celebrities. We published 22 fact-checks related to the Kumbh Mela, of which 31.8% (7 fact-checks) involved AI-generated images of celebrities used to spread misinformation, falsely showing them attending the event. For instance, fake images of X owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, along with professional wrestlers John Cena, Brock Lesnar, and Roman Reigns, went viral claiming they were at the festival.

Another fake image of a letter went viral on social media, falsely claiming that godman Dheerendra Shastri had predicted the stampede at the Kumbh Mela, which resulted in 30 deaths and several injuries. We ran the image through Hive Moderation and another AI detection tool, SightEngine, both of which indicated a 95% likelihood that the image was AI-generated.

Arvind Kejriwal was the most targeted politician (5 fact-checks), with false claims made against him. Misinformation was also directed at PM Modi (3 fact-checks), the Aam Aadmi Party (2 fact-checks) and Rahul Gandhi (1 fact-check). On the other hand the BJP and its party members spread the most misinformation on social media. BOOM published 5 fact-checks which consisted of claims mostly targeting AAP or Kejriwal. For example, a video of Kejriwal was posted on BJP Delhi’s Facebook page, where he is seen saying that he has started to understand politics a little, and that cleaning the Yamuna river won't get him votes. The BJP's post claimed, “Kejriwal has now started understanding a little politics and now he has also understood that cleaning Yamuna ji, the symbol of faith and devotion of Hindus, will not get AAP votes. He is an extremely cunning man.” However, BOOM found that the video had been cropped. In the original video, Kejriwal is talking about his efforts to clean the Yamuna river, even though it won't earn him votes. AAP too, in one instance, posted an AI clip on Instagram and X, showing a luxurious palace-like residence and claiming it was the newly proposed residence of PM Modi as part of the Central Vista project. The video was shared by AAP with a Hindi caption, which translates to English as, ""Big Breaking... The video of the royal palace has come before the public for the first time. Is this why the doors of the royal palace are not opened for the public?"" BOOM ran the video by our partners at the Deepfakes Analysis Unit, a public awareness platform combating misinformation, who provided further evidence confirming that it was entirely AI-generated.

A series of wildfires in Southern California in early January sparked misinformation online, including AI-generated videos of firefighters rescuing animals that were presented as real footage. Additionally, an old and unrelated video was falsely shared, claiming that Muslims had started calling for prayer to extinguish the fires in Los Angeles. Social media was also flooded with misinformation, including a video that falsely showed American pop star Taylor Swift calling the ongoing wildfires a ""divine retribution"" against the United States for supporting Israel's bombings in Gaza. However, several deepfake detection tools revealed a high likelihood that voice cloning and lip-syncing algorithms had been used to manipulate the video. 51.7% of the 89 fact-checks were shared via videos, followed by images (39.3%), texts (7.9%%) and audio (1.1%). Regarding the intent behind spreading mis/disinformation, 93.3% of the total fact-checks were under the “Sensationalist” category. This was followed by “Smear Campaigns” against Indian political leaders (5.6%) and the intent of spreading “Demographic Anxiety” (1.1%).",2025-02-11T12:21:55+00:00,https://www.boomlive.in/boom-research/boom-misinformation-report-january-maha-kumbh-delhi-assembly-elections-2025-27748,9f52345519014128bdd388d55a7bc411

"According to Bitwise Asset Management, individual holders control most of Bitcoin’s (BTC) total supply. 69.4% of the 21 million BTC total supply belongs to private investors.

Given this concentration of ownership among individuals, large institutions and governments seeking to acquire Bitcoin may face challenges.

In a recent X post, Bitwise outlined Bitcoin’s total supply distribution. Apart from individual holders, approximately 7.5% of Bitcoin is considered lost. Funds and exchange-traded products (ETPs) control 6.1%.

The wallet associated with Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, holds 4.6%. Moreover, governments and businesses collectively own just 5.8% of Bitcoin.

The asset manager highlighted that if companies and governments wish to acquire Bitcoin, they will primarily need to purchase it from individuals willing to sell.

Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise, also pointed out that despite consistent buying from corporates and ETFs, Bitcoin’s price has still faced downward pressure. He also stressed that the bulk of Bitcoin’s value remains in the hands of individual holders.

Meanwhile, only 5.7% of Bitcoin remains to be mined. In addition, OTC (Over-the-Counter) markets are running low on Bitcoin. A crypto analyst highlighted that just 140,000 BTC remains in the OTC market.

The analyst explained ETFs collectively purchased 50,000 BTC last month. Yet, price movements remained subdued. This suggested that institutions source Bitcoin from OTC markets rather than exchanges to avoid triggering price surges.

Nonetheless, this strategy may no longer be viable with OTC supply depleting.

He added that if MicroStrategy (now Strategy) continues its aggressive acquisitions or ETFs maintain their January-level accumulation, OTC Bitcoin could be depleted. A similar scenario would unfold if the US and the states began buying Bitcoin as part of their reserves.

Strategy has maintained a consistent Bitcoin acquisition plan. On February 10, the firm purchased 7,633 BTC for approximately $742.4 million. This marked its fifth Bitcoin purchase in 2025 alone. According to Saylor Tracker, the firm now holds 478,740 BTC, valued at $47.12 billion.

Institutions such as BlackRock are also adding pressure to supply. The asset manager reportedly acquired $1 billion worth of BTC in January. In fact, it bought 227 BTC today, according to Arkham Intelligence.

Nevertheless, as supply tightens, institutions may soon be forced to buy directly from exchanges, potentially driving Bitcoin’s price significantly higher.

This supply shock threat looms as Bitcoin adoption accelerates. In a previous report, BlackRock noted that cryptocurrency reached 300 million users faster than the internet and mobile phones.

Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, also weighed in on the adoption timeline comparison.

He added that the comparison depends on how one defines the official starting points for Bitcoin, the internet, and mobile phones. However, Armstrong acknowledged that the overall trend is still accurate despite these variables.",2025-02-11T12:24:26+00:00,https://pandoraland.info/bitwise-69-of-bitcoin-supply-held-by-individuals-as-institutions-fall-behind/,57064ee93e0c4643971d5b57e1e3425d
"Fans of the European Song Contest (ESC) waited for this: On February 14th, 15th and 22nd, the jury of ""Chefsache ESC 2025"" on RTL will choose the top candidates for the subsequent ESC preliminary decision on March 1. In the first three shows, 24 musical applicants have to demonstrate their skills in front of Stefan Raab, Yvonne Catterfeld and Elton. Among the candidates is the Düsseldorf singer Julika Elisabeth Lüer.

In an interview with the ""NRZ"", the 23-year-old remembers the application phase: ""I secretly sent the application in class,"" said the prospective speech therapist. Her silent action was not unnoticed - the young musician was invited to the casting a little later.

But that's not all: Julika learned in mid -December that Stefan Raab selected her from 3281 applications. This means that the Düsseldorf native is one of the 24 candidates who will compete in the big ESC preliminary decision ""Chef's matter ESC 2025-who sings for Germany?"".

Who is the Düsseldorf ESC candidate?

Julika began to make music at the age of nine, and composed songs in English. Her piano -playing mother was great inspiration, but also childhood figures like Hannah Montana, as she reveals in an interview with RTL. In her songs, the artist combines emotional depths with strong contrasts.

Also exciting: concerts, festivals and sports events in NRW: These big events take place in 2025

The young singer is by no means lacking on stage experience: since 2016 she is said to have been on more than 300 live performances in clubs, scene pubs, open-stage concerts, acoustic slams, open-air concerts and at festivals, reports The ""NRZ"". The Düsseldorf woman, which she has been pursuing since childhood, still looks at a little nervous. “This is a completely different setting. Millions of people watch me singing, but I'm looking forward to this experience, ”she told the newspaper.

Julika particularly appreciates that even smaller artists are offered a stage. ""This is about music and about finding the best contribution to Germany,"" said her statement in an interview. Which song she will perform in the preliminary decision remains strictly secret - it will probably be a pop song in English.

This is how it goes on for Julika

Should the Düsseldorf woman prevail in the three prime time shows at the end of February, she is imminent to the live final on March 1st. There the spectators choose the winner, who will sing for Germany in Basel on May 17th. The final is broadcast on the first, in the ARD media library, on Eurovision.de and on One and, like the previous shows, is moderated by Babara Schöneberger.

Reading tip: Ratinger Hof in Düsseldorf restarted in 2025: First concerts already planned!

If Julika makes it into the all -important show, she presents a self -written song that would also perform in the final in Switzerland. No details have so far been known about this song - however, it should be a previously unpublished piece.",2025-02-11T12:21:51+00:00,https://www.tonight.de/duesseldorf/saengerin-julika-aus-duesseldorf-esc-vorentscheid-rtl_387994.html,ae3bc85082ae4cf8879376bf222f92ba

"Boston is no stranger to unpredictable winter weather, but this week is shaping up to be a slow build toward what could be a messy weekend storm. The start of the week will be business as usual—cold days, freezing nights, and some light snow—but things could take a turn by Saturday. Whether you’re commuting, running errands, or planning weekend travel, here’s the full breakdown to help you prepare.

Your Daily Forecast—What to Expect Each Day

Tuesday:

Clouds roll in, bringing a grey, overcast day with highs near 33°F (0°C). By night, the thermometer will dip to 18°F (-8°C). Not exactly a great day for outdoor plans, but nothing too extreme either. Just another cold winter day.

Wednesday:

We get a brief break from the gloom with a few peeks of sunshine. Don’t get too excited, though—temperatures will still hover around 33°F (1°C), and by nighttime, we’ll be back in the upper 20s. Still, after all the clouds, a little sunlight might lift your mood.

Thursday:

Thursday kicks off with some light snow in the morning—nothing major, just a dusting of about 1 to 3 centimeters. It’s the kind of snow that looks pretty but melts quickly. The high will reach 42°F (6°C), so if you need to shovel your driveway, do it early before it turns to slush. By night, temperatures will drop to 21°F (-6°C), and things could start feeling icy.

Friday:

Sunny but cold. Highs around 30°F (-1°C) and lows dipping to 18°F (-8°C). It’s a calm day, but it might be the last one before the weekend storm. Use Friday to run errands or grab any essentials you might need in case Saturday’s storm gets messy.

Saturday:

This is when things get interesting. A storm system will move in during the afternoon, bringing periods of snow. Temperatures will stay near freezing, with highs around 33°F (1°C) and lows around 32°F (0°C). It’s still too early to say how much snow will accumulate, but be prepared for slick sidewalks and messy roads.

Sunday:

Sunday could bring a mix of rain and snow. Temperatures will peak at 40°F (4°C) during the day but drop quickly to 20°F (-7°C) at night. The real concern is the rain transitioning into snow as temperatures fall, which could lead to icy roads and dangerous black ice. If you’re driving Sunday evening, be extra cautious.

Why This Week’s Weather Deserves Your Attention

At first glance, the forecast looks pretty typical—cold, some snow, nothing Boston hasn’t seen before. But the potential weekend storm is worth keeping an eye on. Depending on how the storm tracks, we could see moderate snowfall, a mix of rain and snow, or icy conditions. If the system hugs the coast, Boston could be looking at heavier snow. But if it moves inland, expect more of a slushy mess. Either way, the weekend could bring some travel headaches.

Tips to Help You Stay Ahead of the Weather:
• Layer Up: It’ll be cold all week, especially at night. Dress in layers and cover any exposed skin to avoid frostbite.
• Check Road Conditions: Even light snow can create icy patches on roads, especially early in the morning or late at night. Give yourself extra time if you’re commuting.
• Be Prepared for Power Outages: If the weekend storm brings ice, power lines could be affected. Keep flashlights, batteries, and extra blankets on hand.
• Stay Updated: The weekend forecast could change quickly. Check in with local weather reports for updates—storms like this can shift at the last minute.
• Stock Up on Essentials: Don’t wait until Saturday to grab milk, bread, or other groceries. If the storm intensifies, you’ll be glad you planned ahead.

Why the Weekend Storm Could Be a Problem

Right now, meteorologists are keeping a close watch on how this storm will develop. A slight shift in the track could mean the difference between a manageable snowfall and a messy mix of rain and ice. If temperatures drop faster than expected, we could see icy roads, school closures, and delays at Logan Airport.

But, hey—this is Boston, and we’ve dealt with worse. The key is to stay ahead of it. If you’re planning to travel this weekend, keep an eye on the forecast and be ready to adjust your plans if needed.

This week may not start off with a bang, but by the weekend, things could get a little chaotic. Use the calm days to prepare, and don’t let the changing forecast catch you off guard. Whether you’re out for a stroll on Wednesday or shoveling snow on Saturday, be safe, be smart, and stay warm.",2025-02-11T12:21:47+00:00,https://branfordseven.com/warning-for-bostonians-a-week-of-winter-hazards-leading-up-to-a-potential-weekend-storm/,4e050f72a2ec4618ad065192506065a8

"Fundraiser launched for dog who is now home after being stolen seven years ago

Daisy was reunited with her family in Old Buckenham last week (Image: RSPCA)

A fundraising campaign has been launched for a dog who was reunited with her family after being stolen more than seven years ago.

Daisy the labrador was taken from the Old Buckenham home of Philip and Rita Potter in November 2017.

An eyewitness at the time described seeing a man run up the drive before picking up Daisy and putting her in the back of a silver pick-up truck.

She was discovered by RSPCA Inspector Kim Walters during routine investigations in Weston-Super-Mare on February 2 when she saw Daisy and was concerned about her condition.

The inspector rushed Daisy to a vet’s and a scan for a microchip revealed she was stolen and had contact details for Rita and Philip.

She was taken to an RSPCA centre before being driven more than 240 miles across the country on Thursday and back to Norfolk.

Although Daisy is now home, she still needs some medical care and a GoFundMe page has been set up to help Philip and Rita cover the cost of her treatment.

The page has amassed £2,525 so far with donations of up to £100 coming in.

A social media post detailed how it is believed that Daisy was used for breeding while she was away and now has some cysts.

The fundraising page says that Daisy is in need of ""some operations to make her comfortable”.

When reunited with her dog, Rita said: “We know she is elderly now and has health issues but whatever time she has left she will now be surrounded by lots of love and attention.

"At the AI Action Summit 2025 hosted in Paris, France, Google CEO Sundar Pichai spoke about how AI can influence various sectors such as education, healthcare, science, etc. and why the company invests as much in the industry.

While Google has taken multiple opportunities to showcase how the company plans to use AI to benefit humanity, Pichai’s recent talk included several personal anecdotes as he urged the world to embrace AI and address issues related to public policy.

He took the stage to help ease the scepticism associated with AI and spoke about how policies must be framed with a balanced approach.

“I grew up doing math using logarithmic tables, and I was uncomfortable watching my kids learn math with smartphones. They’ve turned out just fine,” he added.

‘We Mustn’t Let Our Bias for Present Get in Way of Future’

Pichai began his talk by sharing his experiences while growing up in Chennai. He shared how he had to wait five years before his family acquired a rotary phone, which changed their lives.

Moreover, he revealed once he had to take a “four-hour round trip” to get blood test results for his mother, but, now, all he needed to do was just pick up the phone.

Citing similar examples, Pichai highlighted the power of transformative technologies. “We’re still in the early days, yet I already believe AI will be the most profound shift of our lifetimes,” he said.

Pichai added that to unlock the full potential of AI, an ecosystem of innovators must be enabled, and a powerful infrastructure must be built. “We’re excited for the path [US] President [Donald] Trump, [French] President [Emmanuel] Macron and other countries are forging here,” he said.

Pichai highlighted the need for industries to invest in people and prepare them for the workforce ahead. He believes people will have to act boldly to advance the applications of AI responsibly.

Along these lines, Pichai outlined a framework for a successful AI public policy. This policy must address the risks associated with the technology without affecting progress. He also suggested that policies must fill gaps and draw on existing laws instead of creating new ones.

However, the AI race is not limited to the United States. China made a bold entry recently, France is showing promise with Mistral, and India is actively working on a foundational model. Hence, Pichai suggested that policies must be aligned across countries.

“AI can’t flourish if there is a fragmented regulatory environment, with different rules across different countries and regions,” he said.

According to him, AI is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to improve lives. “We must not let our own bias for the present get in the way of the future.”

Taking the stage at the summit, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said that AI is the code for humanity.

PM Modi said AI is developing at an unprecedented scale and speed, and being adapted and deployed even faster. He stressed the need for collective global efforts to establish governance and standards.

“Governance is not just about managing risk and rivalries, it is also about promoting innovation

and deploying it for the global good. So we must think deeply and discuss openly about innovation and governance,” he said, echoing Pichai’s sentiment.

Aligning with Pichai’s expectations, Macron said that Europe is planning to reduce AI regulations. As per Reuters, European Union’s digital chief Henna Virkkunen promised to simplify rules and implement them in a business-friendly way.

With regards to AI infrastructure in France, Macron announced plans for €109 billion of private AI investment, analogous to The Stargate Project in the US.

The recent few events have been a ray of hope for Europe and its relatively restricted tech ecosystem. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, announced that the company is opening a new office in Munich, Germany. This is in addition to their previous offices in Dublin, London, Paris and Brussels.

Furthermore, Mistral announced plans to invest “several billion euros” in building its first data centre in France. The AI startup also recently announced a new application called Le Chat, which it claimed is the fastest AI assistant capable of producing over 1,000 tokens per second. The chatbot is powered by Cerebras Inference, which is also touted as the world’s fastest AI inference engine.",2025-02-11T12:23:09+00:00,https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-news-updates/it-was-uncomfortable-to-watch-my-kids-learn-math-on-smartphones-but-they-turned-out-fine-says-google-ceo/,34e63fee378e4375ab866b7499ad9516
"SOUTHINGTON — Crews are clearing a rollover crash on Interstate 84 westbound Tuesday morning that left a driver with serious injuries, according to state police.

The sponsor, who has not been identified, pulled funding for the event after learning the two-week festival would include events with drag performers. “We are saddened and disappointed by the last-minute decision by a major donor to pull funding for this festival which celebrates all types of performing arts without prejudice,” said Chris Bass, Savannah Performing Arts Festival Executive Director. The inaugural festival runs through February 22 and is being held at the Ben Tucker Theatre at the Savannah Cultural Arts Center and other locations around Savannah. The festival includes multiple panels, interactive events, spotlight shows, luncheons, performances, and a one night only gala. A highlight of the festival includes the Tony Award-winning musical “A Gentleman’s Guide to Love & Murder."" “We will continue with our full lineup of planned events, but we are seeking additional funding to make up for this significant revenue shortage,"" said Bass. ""We are appealing to locals and visitors to purchase tickets and make donations to support diversity, equity, and inclusion in the arts.” Festival organizers confirm that all the panels, including “The Art of Drag,” performances, an awards gala, and a full production of ""A Gentleman's Guide to Love & Murder,” will continue as planned. Ticket packages including over 20 events as well as tickets for individual performances, events, and programming are available.

"Former Spanish football chief Luis Rubiales has told a court that he was ""absolutely sure"" player Jenni Hermoso consented to him kissing her.

Rubiales is on trial in Madrid accused of sexual assault for kissing Hermoso on the lips after Spain won the Women's World Cup in Sydney in August 2023.

Giving evidence today, he told the court that he asked Ms Hermoso if he could kiss her before it happened.

""When Jenny came up to me, she kind of made a face. We've known each other for a long time. Obviously, the kiss was because we became champions.

""She'd missed a penalty and with all the tension during the game, I said, 'forget about the penalty - we're champions and this is down to you. Without you, we wouldn't have done it'.

""And she hugged me very, very hard just below my armpits and lifted me off the ground.

""When I kind of hit the ground again, I said, 'can you can I give you a kiss?' and she said, 'okay',"" he claimed.

He also said that the ""law of physics"" meant that he could not be ""on top of her"" during the kiss, as the prosecution framed the incident.

""My feet come off the ground, you'll see that. I do what I can to not fall over and lose my balance. Anybody, who knows anything about the law of physics knows that, you have to bend your knees in order to take off the ground,"" he said.

Rubiales also denied that he drafted a statement about the kiss, but said he did ask Ms Hermoso to jointly release a statement about the kiss - but she refused.

He said he did apologise to Ms Hermoso for the kiss in the days after and asked for forgiveness, saying he ""got carried away by the emotion and euphoria"".

The 47-year-old is also charged with attempting to coerce Ms Hermoso - with the help of three other former soccer federation officials - into publicly saying the kiss was consensual.

The ensuing scandal after the kiss eclipsed Spain's first women's World Cup victory and proved a tipping point for efforts by Spain's female players to expose sexism and achieve parity with male counterparts.

"Nokia. The one brand that still evokes a great amount of nostalgia. While Nokia may have lost its sheen and its glory days, the company is apparently still making some reliable phones. Over the years, the Finland-based company has especially turned its focus on making phones with gaming features. In its heyday, the company boasted quite a few successful products in the highly competitive gaming niche. Whether the current lineup of gaming phones helps Nokia in reviving its fortunes remains to be seen.

But by all means, it does appear that Nokia is finally making some right moves, compelling us to write this blog post. This post will shed light on some of the top Nokia gaming mobile phones for gamers.

While most of the Nokia gaming mobile phones mentioned below are not out-and-out gaming phones, they do come with some powerful hardware specs, making them a perfect choice for gamers.

On this note, let’s straight away deep-dive into our blog post.

The first one in our list is Nokia XR20. There are two good reasons why this one tops our list. One is its powerful ‘Snapdragon 695’ processor and other is its impressive RAM size of 6 GB. Both these superlative hardware specs make sure that playing any game, including high-end and graphically demanding games, is a seamless process.

Its internal hardware specs are no doubt powerful, but some of its external hardware is just as impressive. The most notable is its display, which by all means is one of the toughest displays that you could find in the market. Its scratch-resistant, drop-resistant, and water-resistant.

This means that you can play any game carefreely. Whether it is action-packed games or laid-back puzzle games, its sturdiness won’t let you down.

Last but not least. It also has a good battery life, so playing games for hours on Nokia XR20 without having to search for charger is always a feasible option.

Nokia X30 packs enough punch to rattle the heart of any avid gamer. Its powerful Snapdragon 695 processor makes sure that you easily get to play and enjoy the most high-end games. But it is not merely the brute power, what also sets Nokia X30 apart is its AMOLED display. For all those who are unaware, playing games or experiencing any form of entertainment on AMOLED display is always a pleasure. AMOLED displays are known for offering fine and crisp details, ensuring that your gaming experience is always going to be a truly immersive experience.

Nokia G42 may not be the most powerful gaming phone, but it more than makes up with other features for its lack of powerful processor. To begin with, it has a long battery life, which means less reliance on chargers and power adapters. Add to this a 6.5-inch HD+ display that will make sure that playing games on Nokia G42 is never really a dull experience. Lastly, its snapdragon 480+ may not be exactly a very powerful processor but is powerful enough to offer a decent gaming experience. And for all these, Nokia G42 is more than worth every bit of your penny.

Nokia 8.3 being an old model, its inclusion might raise few eyebrows. But despite being outdated, it still packs enough punch. Its Snapdragon 765 G processor with up to 8 GB RAM makes it more than decently powerful to efficiently run any online game. And despite being an old model, you can still easily enjoy multiplayer games. This is all thanks to the fact that this phone supports 5G network. Now this is what we call old is gold.

With all its standard features, Nokia G60 5G is your quintessential gaming friendly mobile phone. From a powerful processor ‘Snapdragon 695’ to 6.58-inch Full FD display, this Nokia phone has all the trademark features that will enthrall any die-hard gamer. Talking about the trade-mark features, it is worth noting that this phone supports 5G network.

Which among the five models fits your bill will depend on various factors, mainly your budget and whether you’re a causal gamer or a diehard gamer. For all those who are truly passionate about gaming, the Nokia XR20 and Nokia X30 probably make a better choice. Other models are more suitable for those who are fond of playing casual and mid-range games. While Nokia may pale when compared with today’s big brands like Samsung and Xiaomi, it is by no means a bad brand. Not at least for gamers who want to enjoy a decent gaming experience on their mobile phones.",2025-02-11T12:13:39+00:00,https://www.techpluto.com/top-nokia-gaming-mobile-phones-for-gamers/,7cf4b9d315c84b94943195858bda6192

"President Donald Trump will welcome Jordan's King Abdullah II to the White House Tuesday as he escalates pressure on Gaza's future.

The meeting comes after Trump proposed for the U.S. to take control of Gaza and turn it into the ""Riviera of the Middle East"" during a joint news conference with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Trump suggested that, if necessary, he would withhold U.S. funding from Jordan and Egypt, longtime U.S. allies and among the top recipients of its foreign aid, as a means of persuading them to accept additional Palestinians from Gaza.

Jordan’s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, said last week that his country’s opposition to Trump’s idea was “firm and unwavering.”

In addition to concerns about jeopardizing the long-held goals of a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Egypt and Jordan have privately raised security concerns about welcoming large numbers of additional refugees into their countries even temporarily.

Trump Thursday said that ""no soldiers by the U.S. would be needed"" to take over the Gaza strip.

Adding to the tension, Hamas accused Israel of a ceasefire breach and said it is pausing future releases of hostages as Trump called for Israel to resume fighting if the hostages aren't returned by midday Saturday.

“If they’re not here, all hell is going to break out,"" Trump said. He added of the ceasefire, “Cancel it, and all bets are off.”

During his visit, the king will also meet with top Trump administration officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

"COTABATO CITY (MindaNews / 11 February) — Two separate shooting incidents occurred in Buluan, Maguindanao del Sur on Tuesday, police confirmed.

Lt. Dean Macusi, Buluan police chief, however, declined to give details amid claims that one of the shooting incidents was an “ambush-drama.”

Macusi said in a phone interview that they were still gathering evidence, witnesses accounts and CCTV footage to determine what really happened, which also involved a 13-year-old boy.

Anwar Dimasinsil, who is running for the town’s vice mayoralty race, posted on Facebook that his convoy was allegedly ambushed, pointing to a light gray car as behind the attack.

He said that the driver of their sports utility vehicle (SUV) was hit by a bullet, but was not hurt as he was wearing a bullet proof vest.

The incident happened around 11 a.m. along the national highway of the town, not far from the Maguindanao del Sur provincial capitol.

But former Maguindanao Governor Esmael “Toto” Mangudadatu alleged that the shooting of Dimasinsil’s SUV could be an “ambush-drama.”

Dimasinsil is allied with the rival camp of Mangudadatu, who is running for Maguindanao del Sur representative.

The 13-year-old boy, whose name is withheld for security reasons, said his car was parked at the road side when a pick-up vehicle came close to him.

Feeling uncomfortable, he said he moved forward but then an SUV followed, and when he took a U-turn that was when he was fired at.

Mangudadatu said that the minor, who was driving a light gray car, survived the shooting incident that he blamed on Dimasinsil’s group.

“He was lucky to have survived while inside the car. He drove the car and sought help at the market area,” Mangudadatu said.

Mangudadatu claimed the vehicle of the minor, who is his distant relative and a son of a retired police officer, may have been mistaken by the gunmen and that it was impossible for him to ambush Dimasinsil’s SUV because “the boy was riding only by himself and had no other companions.”

He said the minor was “traumatized while asking for help.”

According to the former governor, Dimasinsil’s group may have staged an “ambush-drama” and that his group may have been the one who fired at their own SUV when they found out that they “had hit the wrong vehicle with a minor inside.”

Mangudadatu said the suspects allegedly cleaned the crime scene.

He called on the authorities to conduct a thorough investigation into the shooting incidents. (Ferdinandh Cabrera / MindaNews)",2025-02-11T12:15:12+00:00,https://mindanews.com/top-stories/2025/02/2-shooting-incidents-mar-maguindanao-sur-town/,8d40c6369b6942f38a2530aefd2751df

"The OnePlus Watch 2 was excellent, but an annoying aspect of the hardware was that the rotating crown didn’t actually work with anything in Wear OS. With the OnePlus Watch 3, the rotating crown actually works.

OnePlus has already announced that the OnePlus Watch 3 is officially launching on February 18, and now the drip-feed of additional details and teasers has begun. First on the list, a big improvement to the rotating crown.

Speaking to TechRadar, OnePlus Europe CMO Celina Shi says that one of the hardware improvements on OnePlus Watch 3 is the addition of a real rotating crown.

The rotating crown has been a key part of many smartwatches for years, popularized primarily by the Apple Watch. Most Wear OS smartwatches have also used the tech, including Google’s Pixel Watch and products from Fossil, Mobvoi, and other brands. But the OnePlus Watch 2 ignored it, rather equipping a “rotating” crown that only physically rotated, lacking any ability to use that rotation to interact with the software as has become so common on other watches. The rotating movement is generally tied to scrolling or zoom in the software, and can be helpful for quickly navigating the small screen.

For the OnePlus Watch 3, the rotating crown will indeed interact with Wear OS, making “navigating through apps and menus efficient and intuitive.”

We put much focus on design with the OnePlus Watch 2 and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. But we did hear calls from our community to develop the rotating crown to offer functionality and an alternative way to navigate the device. With the ability to both press and rotate, the rotating crown makes navigating through apps and menus efficient and intuitive – and ultimately the user experience even better.

The interview also goes on to discuss the OnePlus Watch 3’s bigger battery and, in turn, improved endurance, as well as teasing some durability enhancements.

"(CNN) — As the confetti fell and his Philadelphia Eagles teammates celebrated all around him, Jalen Hurts continued to look like the calmest man at Super Bowl LIX.

He had just achieved his dream, lifting the Vince Lombardi Trophy after five NFL seasons full of highs and lows, expectation and pressure.

Instantly after the game, Hurts told reporters he was processing his emotions, and it still appears the Super Bowl MVP hasn’t quite come to terms with his achievement.

“I’m still processing it,” the quarterback told CNN’s Phil Mattingly on The Lead while celebrating with his family at Walt Disney World in Florida.

“I don’t know if there is an expected feeling that you’re supposed to feel, I just think about all the effort, all the time, all the blood, sweat and tears that have been put in over the course of my career, all of the lessons learned through the ups and the downs. So it’s something that I appreciate a ton.

“I give a ton of gratitude to everything I’ve had to endure. I also give a ton of gratitude to my teammates, my family and all the support.”

It wasn’t any ordinary performance from Hurts on Sunday, quite possibly the best of his career – collegiate or pro.

The 26-year-old set a new Super Bowl record for rushing yards (72) by a quarterback and also threw 17-for-22 for 221 yards for two touchdowns and an interception as his team completely dominated the Chiefs.

It was a quarterback showing worthy of all the praise he has received since, but guiding a team to Super Bowl glory wasn’t always on the cards for Hurts.

His first taste of the big stage came back in 2017 when he led his Alabama Crimson Tide to the College Football Playoff national championship game. That proved to be Hurts’ first real taste of disappointment as ‘Bama lost a thriller to Clemson, 35-31.

A year later, he was back in the same game but got benched for Tua Tagovailoa at halftime due to his poor performance. The Crimson Tide beat Georgia in overtime courtesy of Tagovailoa’s heroics, but Hurts was demoted to a backup the next season.

It was a knock that Hurts had no option but to take, and he later transferred to Oklahoma, successfully rebuilding himself with the Sooners as an NFL prospect.

In 2023, he then had a shot at history on the biggest stage of them all, leading the Eagles to the Super Bowl against the Kansas City Chiefs. Despite playing well, Hurts suffered another defeat.

“Everything happens right on time. You just have to run your race and stay the course,” he told CNN after finally overcoming his critics.

“It’s been a journey of highs and lows and different moments where I’ve had opportunities to learn from. I never ran from any challenges, I didn’t let a bump in the road deter me from what I envisioned for myself and that’s just to be the best man, the best leader and best player that I can be.

“To find myself in Philadelphia and to make history and bring another championship home to this city, it means everything.”",2025-02-11T10:56:16+00:00,https://kion546.com/sports/cnn-sports/2025/02/11/philadelphia-eagles-qb-jalen-hurts-still-processing-fairytale-win-at-super-bowl-lix-2/,f75bfb6b222d42e386e90e4d9dd4c028
"PARIS (AP) — U.S. Vice President JD Vance on Tuesday warned global leaders and tech industry executives that “excessive regulation” could cripple the rapidly growing artificial intelligence industry in a rebuke to European efforts to curb AI’s risks.

The United States, under President Donald Trump, champions a hands-off approach to fuel innovation, while Europe is tightening the reins with strict regulations to ensure safety and accountability. Meanwhile, China is rapidly expanding AI through state-backed tech giants, vying for dominance in the global race.

At the end of the day, the U.S. was noticeably absent from a joint statement signed by more than 60 nations, pledging to “promote AI accessibility to reduce digital divides” and “ensure AI is open, inclusive, transparent, ethical, safe, secure and trustworthy.”

The agreement also called for “making AI sustainable for people and the planet” and protecting “human rights, gender equality, linguistic diversity, protection of consumers and of intellectual property rights.”

In a surprise, China — long criticized for its human rights record — signed the declaration, leaving the U.S. as the outlier.

At the summit, Vance made his first major policy speech since becoming vice president last month, framing AI as an economic turning point but cautioning that “at this moment, we face the extraordinary prospect of a new industrial revolution, one on par with the invention of the steam engine.""

""But it will never come to pass if overregulation deters innovators from taking the risks necessary to advance the ball,” Vance added.

The 40-year-old vice president, leveraging the AI summit and a security conference in Munich later this week, is seeking to project Trump’s forceful new style of diplomacy.

The Trump administration will “ensure that AI systems developed in America are free from ideological bias,” Vance said and pledged the U.S. would “never restrict our citizens’ right to free speech.”

Vance also took aim at foreign governments for “tightening the screws” on U.S. tech firms, saying such moves were troubling. His remarks underscored the growing divide between Washington and its European allies on AI governance.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stressed that, “AI needs the confidence of the people and has to be safe″ and detailed EU guidelines intended to standardize the bloc’s AI Act but acknowledged concerns over regulatory burden.

“At the same time, I know that we have to make it easier and we have to cut red tape and we will,” she added.

She also announced that the “InvestAI” initiative had reached a total of €200 billion in AI investments across Europe, including €20 billion dedicated to AI gigafactories.

The summit laid bare competing global AI strategies — Europe pushing to regulate and invest, China is expanding AI through state-backed giants, and the U.S. is doubling down on an unregulated free-market approach.

Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, special envoy of Xi Jinping, underscored Beijing’s intent to shape global AI standards at the summit.

Vance, a vocal critic of European content moderation policies, has suggested the U.S. should reconsider its NATO commitments if European governments impose restrictions on Elon Musk’s social media platform, X. His Paris visit was also expected to include candid discussions on Ukraine, AI’s role in global power shifts, and U.S.-China tensions.

Concerns over AI’s potential dangers have loomed over the summit, particularly as nations grapple with how to regulate a technology that is increasingly entwined with defense and warfare.

""I think one day we will have to find ways to control AI or else we will lose control of everything,” said Admiral Pierre Vandier, NATO’s commander who oversees the alliance’s modernization efforts.

Beyond diplomatic tensions, a global public-private partnership is being launched called “Current AI,” aimed at supporting large-scale AI initiatives for the public good.

Analysts see this as an opportunity to counterbalance the dominance of private companies in AI development. However, it remains unclear whether the U.S. will support such efforts.

Separately, a high-stakes battle over AI power is escalating in the private sector.

A group of investors led by Musk — who now heads Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency — has made a $97.4 billion bid to acquire the nonprofit behind OpenAI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, attending the Paris summit, swiftly rejected the offer on X.

In Beijing, officials on Monday condemned Western efforts to restrict access to AI tools, while Chinese company DeepSeek’s new AI chatbot has prompted calls in the U.S. Congress to limit its use over security concerns. China promotes open-source AI, arguing that accessibility will ensure global AI benefits.

French organizers hope the summit will boost investment in Europe’s AI sector, positioning the region as a credible contender in an industry shaped by U.S.-China competition.

French President Emmanuel Macron, addressing the energy demands of AI, contrasted France’s nuclear-powered approach with the U.S.‘s reliance on fossil fuels, quipping: France won't “drill, baby, drill,” but ""plug, baby, plug.”

Vance’s diplomatic tour will continue in Germany, where he will attend the Munich Security Conference and press European allies to increase commitments to NATO and Ukraine. He may also meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Vance will discuss Ukraine and the Middle East over a working lunch with Macron.

Like Trump, he has questioned U.S. aid to Kyiv and the broader Western strategy toward Russia. Trump has pledged to end the war in Ukraine within six months of taking office.

Vance is also set to meet separately with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

"• Significantly high institutional ownership implies Public Service Enterprise Group's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions
• 50% of the business is held by the top 20 shareholders
• Insiders have been selling lately

A look at the shareholders of Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (NYSE:PEG) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 77% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).

Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.

In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Public Service Enterprise Group.

Check out our latest analysis for Public Service Enterprise Group

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Public Service Enterprise Group?

Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Public Service Enterprise Group. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Public Service Enterprise Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.

Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Public Service Enterprise Group. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 11% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.3% by the third-largest shareholder.

After doing some more digging, we found that the top 20 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.

Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.

The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our information suggests that Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$46m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 23% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies. I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks for example - Public Service Enterprise Group has 2 warning signs (and 1 which is potentially serious) we think you should know about. But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

"West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, on Monday, informed party legislators, that Trinamool Congress will be contesting alone in the Bengal Assembly elections in 2026 without having any understanding with another party including Congress.

She told party legislators while having a meeting with the members of the party’s legislative team in the West Bengal Assembly before the commencement of the first day of the budget session of the house on Monday afternoon.

“Congress has nothing in West Bengal. So there is no question of having an alliance with Congress in the state. Trinamool Congress will be contesting alone in West Bengal. We will form the government again for the fourth time in 2016 securing a two-thirds majority,” the Chief Minister said at the meeting as claimed by a senior member of the state cabinet.

However, the state cabinet member added that during the meeting the Chief Minister had squarely blamed Congress for the result of the recently concluded Delhi Assembly polls where BJP came to power winning 48 out of 70 seats in the state assembly there.

“In Delhi, Congress did not help the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Again in Haryana AAP did not help Congress. As a result, BJP emerged as the victor in both the states. Had Congress and AAP remained united in Delhi and Haryana, the results would not have been such for the opposition in both the states,” the state cabinet minister said quoting Mamata Banerjee.

During the meeting, the Chief Minister also reportedly cautioned some of the party legislators whose recent statements made in public had posed immense embarrassment for the party leadership.

The state cabinet member said that the Chief Minister cautioned the leaders on this count that the same mistake repeated again and again cannot be pardoned. Recently, a comment by one such maverick legislator Madan Mitra, claiming that becoming a member of the party’s district committee against money is quite common, had posed immense embarrassment for the leadership.

Although Mitra had already written a letter to the party’s state president in West Bengal Subrata Bakshi apologising for making such a public statement, the party leadership feels that it is high time to caution such loose tongues to be careful in future.

The Chief Minister also gave a strong note of caution against reported events of infighting between two factions of the party mainly at the district- levels. “She specially cautioned the party legislators from Malda and West Burdwan districts,” a legislator present at the meeting said.",2025-02-11T12:24:45+00:00,https://www.newsedge360.com/trinamool-to-contest-2026-bengal-elections-alone-mamata-banerjee/,19d82b9201d245be90e4d5c6f5dbf76e

"New information stickers are being tested in the Kiev subway and asked to leave reviews. These were placed at the Academmic Station: the inscription calls for passengers to move away from the edge of the platform.

Last year, the people of Kiev signed a petition for the installation of protective barriers in the subway - due to increased cases where passengers fell on the track. Seven such cases occurred in half a year of 2024, and some of them were almost in a row.

However, the building codes now do not provide for the installation of any enclosure systems on the platforms. Such a solution will require radical technical changes in the subway. It is also expensive. And yet - will reduce the time of stopping and will violate the schedule of traffic.

"Williams will be officially known as Atlassian Williams Racing this year after agreeing a new title sponsorship deal with the software firm.

The team presented their new sponsor’s logo on the race suits of drivers Carlos Sainz Jnr and Alexander Albon. Williams said the new logo “has been uniquely crafted to unite the identities of Atlassian and Williams Racing, seamlessly combining two distinct marks and incorporating signature blues from each brand’s colour palette.”

The new, long-term deal is Williams’ first title sponsorship since it was branded by Rokit in 2019. That deal was due to continue into the 2020 season but ended in acrimony after Rokit withdrew their backing, leading to a court case.

Williams say their new backing from the Australian company is a “long-term” deal. Under the new arrangement Williams will also use Atlassian’s collaboration software.

“Attracting a title partnership of this size and significance is a momentous day in our team’s illustrious history and a major milestone in our comeback transformation,” said team principal James Vowles.

“We are putting in place all the right ingredients to get this team back to the front of the grid, and in Atlassian we have a partner that through its technology and tools will help unleash our full potential by improving teamwork and collaboration right across the organisation.”

The nine-times constructors’ champions, who last won the title in 1997, will present their new car for the upcoming season at Silverstone on Friday in a “special one-off livery”. The team’s definitive livery will be uncovered at Formula 1’s new pre-season launch event F1 75 Live next week.

Another new sponsor which features on the Williams drivers’ overalls this year is former Ferrari sponsor Santander. The Spanish bank has continued its association with Sainz by switching teams.

"President Donald Trump will welcome Jordan's King Abdullah II to the White House Tuesday as he escalates pressure on Gaza's future.

The meeting comes after Trump proposed for the U.S. to take control of Gaza and turn it into the ""Riviera of the Middle East"" during a joint news conference with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Trump suggested that, if necessary, he would withhold U.S. funding from Jordan and Egypt, longtime U.S. allies and among the top recipients of its foreign aid, as a means of persuading them to accept additional Palestinians from Gaza.

Jordan’s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, said last week that his country’s opposition to Trump’s idea was “firm and unwavering.”

In addition to concerns about jeopardizing the long-held goals of a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Egypt and Jordan have privately raised security concerns about welcoming large numbers of additional refugees into their countries even temporarily.

Trump Thursday said that ""no soldiers by the U.S. would be needed"" to take over the Gaza strip.

Adding to the tension, Hamas accused Israel of a ceasefire breach and said it is pausing future releases of hostages as Trump called for Israel to resume fighting if the hostages aren't returned by midday Saturday.

“If they’re not here, all hell is going to break out,"" Trump said. He added of the ceasefire, “Cancel it, and all bets are off.”

During his visit, the king will also meet with top Trump administration officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

"Dallas Mavericks center Daniel Gafford left the court during Monday’s matchup against the Sacramento Kings due to a sprained right knee. The injury occurred in the second quarter when Gafford set a screen for guard Spencer Dinwiddie at the top of the key and collided with Kings guard Malik Monk.

The impact caused Gafford to fall, visibly in pain, and he was helped off the court after recording four points, three rebounds, and two assists on a perfect 2-for-2 shooting in 10 minutes of play. The Mavericks later announced that Gafford would not return to the game.

With no veteran bigs left to defend the paint, the Mavericks allowed the Kings to rack up an impressive 74 points in the paint, leading to a narrow 129-128 overtime victory at the American Airlines Center.

The loss dropped the Mavericks to a 28-26 record, leaving them just half a game ahead of the Kings (27-26) in the Western Conference standings.

For the Kings, DeMar DeRozan weaved through two defenders to make a clutch basket from the left side with 1.9 seconds left, securing the win. The Mavericks, whose two-game winning streak came to an end, will next face the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday.

Kyrie Irving led the Mavericks with 30 points, nine rebounds, seven assists, and three steals. Spencer Dinwiddie contributed 20 points, five assists, and two steals, while Klay Thompson added 19 points. Olivier-Maxence Prosper and Max Christie also chipped in with 16 and 15 points, respectively.

DeRozan led the Kings with 42 points and seven rebounds. Zach LaVine and Malik Monk each scored 17 points, while Domantas Sabonis posted a near triple-double with 16 points, 15 rebounds, and eight assists. Jonas Valanciunas had 13 points and eight rebounds, and Keegan Murray added 11 points and five rebounds.

Thompson surprised the crowd when he buried a three-pointer to give the Mavericks a slim 128-127 lead with just 9.8 seconds remaining. However, after the Kings called a timeout, DeRozan, trapped between two Mavericks defenders, skillfully slipped through them and scored the game-winning basket.

The Mavericks played without power forward Anthony Davis, who sustained a left adductor strain in Saturday’s 116-105 victory over the Houston Rockets. The duration of his absence remains unclear.

Other Injuries in the Camp

Gafford’s injury marks another significant blow for the Mavericks, who are already grappling with a string of injuries. Recently, the team lost both Anthony Davis and P.J. Washington to injuries. Davis, sidelined with an abductor injury, is out indefinitely, while Washington is dealing with a right ankle sprain. Additionally, newly acquired Caleb Martin is out with a hip injury.

Mavericks head coach Jason Kidd commented on the team’s injury struggles, saying, “I’ve been through it. My job is to tell guys that you have to keep pushing forward, and that’s what this group has done. Through injuries, through trades this past week, the train doesn’t stop. The games keep coming. No one feels sorry for us. That’s just the way the league is. For us to pout, or to want to take our ball and go home, it doesn’t work in this league. You have to fight, and our group is fighting.”

"A new Linux kernel drama has unfolded over these past few weeks, where the maintainer of the DMA mapping helper code refused to accept Rust code. This gave rise to a flurry of arguments from many kernel contributors and even on social media, resulting in one of the contributors eventually quitting over loss of faith in the kernel development process.

I won't go too much into the details of the tiff, but words like “cancer” were thrown around when referring to the maintenance overhead of having a cross-language codebase in the Linux kernel. You can go through the whole thread if you are up for a long read.

Interestingly, a major development has now taken place with a Rust kernel policy being put in place to prevent future conflicts.

Posted by Miguel Ojeda, lead of the Rust for Linux project, this new policy looks to help set the record straight surrounding Rust integration in Linux. If you were not familiar, Rust for Linux is an initiative that's been working towards bringing the advantages of the Rust programming language into the Linux kernel.

It is backed by a community of developers who come from different backgrounds and organizations, with a couple of notable sponsors acting as a driving force.

In its current state, the Rust kernel policy reflects the Rust for Linux team’s best understanding of Rust kernel development, while remaining open to changes.

It lays out key topics like how Rust for Linux is not an effort by the Rust Project or the Rust Foundation, how many key kernel maintainers do support Rust in the kernel, and how changes are not allowed to be introduced if a C change breaks a Rust-enabled build (with an exception for Rust subsystems).

Regarding whether duplicate C or Rust-based drivers are allowed, the policy states that, by default, they are not allowed. However, subsystems may temporarily allow them to make it easier to introduce Rust support and get it working smoothly.

All of that does clarify a lot, and one can only hope that, going forward, this policy will gradually reduce the friction between Rust for Kernel contributors and Linux kernel maintainers.

You can take a look at the Rust kernel policy if you would like to know more.

"Martin Lewis has issued a crucial alert to anyone earning under £23,000, emphasising that they could be entitled to thousands of pounds in assistance with their water bills. On his BBC Podcast, the Money Saving Expert founder said some two million people are not claiming the reductions they're eligible for.

The financial guru pointed out that individuals need to be aware of two types of support available: they must either have an income below £23,000, be receiving certain benefits, or possibly have a medical condition to qualify. He highlighted two schemes designed to alleviate water costs - the social water tariff and Watersure.

Mr Lewis said: ""Now a couple more important updates about water bills. First of all are you one of up to two million homes on low incomes or universal credit missing out on saving hundreds of pounds with a social tariff.""

""These social tariffs are offered by all firms and they can reduce what you pay by up to 90 per cent by lowering or sometimes capping the cost of your bills or your water meter charges. There are almost 2 million households missing out. It's incredibly important if you are on a low income, and exactly what the criteria are depends, but let's say less than £22-23,000 family income or you're on Universal Credit, just get on to your water company's website, see what it's offering or call them and talk to them about it.""

Discussing an additional scheme that can be used with the social tariff, he added: ""There's a separate scheme you could have as well which is called 'Watersure' which is typically worth about £160 a year. To be eligible for the Watersure scheme you need to have a water meter, receive benefits, and either have three or more children or a medical condition such as Crohn's or eczema which means you need to use more water.

""You might be able to have your bills capped under the Watersure scheme and that can work in conjunction with the social tariff.""

In the same podcast, Mr Lewis introduced what he calls his 'three bedroom rule', which could potentially save households £500 or more each month. He explained that it's based on the old rateable value of the property - and by reassessing this, residents could stand to save a substantial amount.

For those with three bedrooms, he suggests considering the number of people living in the home versus the number of rooms. If the number of people is less than or equal to the number of bedrooms, there's a significant chance to cut costs.

He emphasised: ""Water is really important. The first thing I will say is England and Wales only this it works differently in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The first question you ask yourself is 'do you have more or the same number of bedrooms in your property than people'? "".

""Three bedrooms, two people, would count a yes. In that case you are likely to be better off on a water meter than having a bill. Because we talked about the bill is based on the value of your property. Very simply you've got a big house not many people living in it, it's likely to be cheaper if they're measuring your actual water usage. It's going to make it a lot cheaper doing it that way.""

""If that sounds right get onto the Consumer Council for Water's calculator. Just as an example Ursula got in touch with me and said 'I got a water meter fitted as there's only two of us in a three bed house we now pay £16 a month instead of £60 a month.' That's £500 a year cheaper - nothing to be sniffed at.""

""Now some people say to me 'I wanted a water meter and they said I can't have one.' In some ways that is actually the sweet spot because if you can't have a water meter because you might be shared pipes in flats, you can ask for an assessed charge.""",2025-02-11T12:19:39+00:00,https://www.lancs.live/news/cost-of-living/martin-lewis-urgent-warning-anyone-30980282,5b20c67b15fd463a9ec85109f03476ba
"The Federal Government has flagged a lifeline for the embattled Regional Express airline, months after it entered voluntary administration.

The government has announced the latest move to safeguard regional travel provided by REX, which flies into and out of Mount Gambier.

Regional Express went into administration in July last year with estimated debts of $500m. The airline immediately cancelled its services between capital cities, however flights from to and from regional centres, including Mount Gambier, have continued.

The regional services were initially saved after the Federal Government announced it would guarantee regional flight bookings for Rex customers throughout the voluntary administration process.

While the process continues, the government last month took steps to ensure Rex Airlines’ regional services will continue, supporting the administrators on next steps.

In January the government acquired $50m of debt from Rex’s largest creditor, PAGAC Regulus Holdings Limited (PAG), in a bid to prevent an adverse outcome for regional communities, such as liquidation, and ensure the continued connectivity of Australia’s regional and remote communities.

By acquiring the debt, the government has become the principal secured creditor and will seek to become a voting member of the Committee of Inspection.

Whilst the accelerated initial sale process undertaken by the administrators in mid-2024 did not find a suitable buyer for the airlines’ regional operations, the government has continued to work closely with the administrators through the extended convening period.

Federal Transport Minister Catherine King today revealed in capital city media that the government could acquire the airline if a buyer was not found.

Minister King revealed that the government would consider “contingency options”, including “potential Commonwealth acquisition”.

“When markets fail or struggle to deliver for regional communities, the government has a role to ensure people do not miss out on opportunities, education and critical connections,” Minister King said in a statement.

“We are recognising that (today) and stepping in to keep these routes in the air.”",2025-02-11T12:20:59+00:00,https://sevoice.com.au/potential-lifeline-for-airline/,51e8010c16744c6da8074f213429e996
"A furious woman was charged €60 (£49.95) after Ryanair's baggage policy led to her being charged for taking a water bottle on a flight to Dublin.

The Irish airline is known for offering some of the lowest prices, but it also has a reputation for extra charges - and Ruby Flanagan experienced it firsthand.

She was on a short trip so opted to use a backpack and booked a ""non-priority"" £35.86 return ticket, allowing her to bring one ""small"" bag onto the flight to fit under her seat, reports the Mirror. She took a backpack that fits the airline's specific dimensions, which she has used on multiple trips.

Ruby's boarding pass was scanned at 5.30am on Saturday, February 1 at Stansted Airport by Ryanair gate staff and she made her way along the corridor to the flight, with the back pack and 750ml metal water bottle tied to the top handle. However, three days later in Dublin, she reached the gate for her return flight and felt a tap on the shoulder.

""You need to put your bag in here,"" said the Ryanair staff member as she tapped the box. The staff member also sharply pointed to the water bottle, stating: ""That will need to go in the bag.""

Ruby asked if that was necessary, as she didn't need to do that on the incoming flight. The airport staff member responded by saying she needed to have all extras inside her bag when going on the flight and ushered her back to the departure seats.

She stuffed the bottle into her bag and walked to the gate again and was made to rescan her boarding pass. As Ruby stepped forward, another Ryanair staff member jabbered, ""That bag is too big. You'll need to go over there and pay to get on the flight.""

She again asked them why she couldn't take the bottle in her hand like she had on the outgoing flight. Ruby was told the water bottle needed to fit into the bag; otherwise, it would be classed as a ""second bag"", which was not allowed with her ticket.

She watched other backpack passengers holding laptops, Burger King bags and travel pillows pass through without a hitch and says at that point she 'definitely became a difficult customer.'

Other flyers flagged by Ryanair staff also tried to argue their case, with many mirroring her own excuse of ""I flew here with the bag like this, why can't I fly back?""

Ruby says each discussion consisted of a lot of hand flailing, a lot of eye-rolling, the word ""dimensions"" repeated over and over, and a lot of pointing - specifically to a man with the debit card holder at the other end of the gate.

Ruby said: ""Ryanair officially closed the gate for our flight, and, at this point, I was in a state of panic. I'd never missed a flight before. Well, actually, I'd never been told I wasn't allowed on a flight by airstaff before.

""At this point, the plane was set to leave in 15 minutes, and I was not in my seat. So I drifted over to the fella with the card, paid €60, and was tagged with the yellow sticker of shame on my backpack. The sticker was given to the flyers who had not meticulously studied Ryanair's baggage rules and had messed up or blatantly ignored them. I counted at least four on this flight so, if they were all charged €60 then Ryanair made at least an extra £200 from us.""

Ten minutes before the flight's departure, Ruby and another shamed flyer and ran down the stairs to the plane.

After a sprint to her seat, she threw herself down to catch her breath. Ruby says she was shaking, confused, and utterly frustrated at what had happened, and couldn't put it together in her head. On the 50 minute flight back to London, she realised it would've been cheaper to throw the bottle away and buy a new one for £25 when she landed.

She continued: ""After landing, I dragged myself to my coach, filled in a complaint form with Ryanair about the charge, and explained in detail what had happened. In response, Ryanair opened by noting that I was ""disputing a baggage fee charged for carrying a water bottle separate from your carry-on bag"" and then rejected my claim, regurgitated the exact wording from its baggage page on its website.

""After discussing the chaotic experience with colleagues at work, I took the case to Ryanair's press team. I wanted to know if there was a difference between bringing my own water bottle and buying a plastic water bottle at the airport. Would it have gotten through? Also, I asked, did this rule cover neck pillows, scarves, umbrellas, and other things that are connected to bags when travelling?

""Ryanair did not respond to this query and said that I was not permitted to bring the water bottle carrier bag on the flight by itself; it needed to fit within my bag allowance. However, I have yet to find out how I can specifically add the water bottle carrier to my ticket going forward. I will update this article when I know more.""

The statement from Ryanair said: ""This passenger booked a Basic Fare ticket for this flight from Dublin to Stansted (4 Feb), which allowed them to carry a small personal bag onboard. This passenger attempted to board with an additional carry-on, and as it would not fit within their permitted bag, she was correctly required to pay a standard gate baggage fee (€60).

""Once payment was made, this passenger travelled on this flight from Dublin to Stansted (4 Feb).""

"British Airways has issued a warning to passengers who are booking flights after September. The airline issued vouchers to customers who had flights or holidays disrupted due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but these are due to expire later this year. British Airways allowed those who were unable to travel because of Covid-19 restrictions, or had their flights cancelled, to cancel their bookings in exchange for a voucher to spend with the airline at a later date. Customers who accepted the vouchers previously had to take their flights by April 30, 2022, but the deadline was later extended four times. The final date to use these vouchers before they expire is now September 30, 2025, after which they cannot be used. As such, customers need to book flights before the end of September and return by the deadline date in order not to lose out, as the vouchers cannot be used for any flights from October 1 onwards.

In a message to customers on its website, the airline warns: “Our eVouchers offer a quick and simple way of paying for flights online. “You can use either the full value of an eVoucher or some of it to pay for a less expensive booking. If you don’t use all of it, we’ll simply send another eVoucher covering the difference. “The voucher expires on 30 September 2025. You can use an eVoucher to pay or part-pay for a new booking. Any trip booked using your eVoucher must conclude – departure and return – by 30 September 2025.” The airline explains that the voucher value includes the cost of any extras, such as seating, baggage and meal purchases, and customers can apply up to four vouchers per booking. If the cost of flights is cheaper than the value of the voucher then British Airways will issue a new voucher covering the difference, but this new voucher will also only be valid for travel that is completed by the deadline of September 30, 2025 - it will not have a new extended expiry date. If bookings exceed the value of the vouch then customers will have to pay the difference.

British Airways adds: “An eVoucher is valid until the expiry date shown and cannot be renewed or exchanged for cash. All flights booked using eVouchers issued following an application must conclude by 30 September 2025. “If you cancel a booking made using an eVoucher you applied for, any refund will be issued in accordance with our Conditions of Carriage and the relevant fare rules. “Where you cancel the booking and a refund is due, the amount paid for using the eVoucher will be issued under a new eVoucher. If we cancel your flight, you will be entitled to a full refund of your booking.”",2025-02-11T12:18:00+00:00,https://www.express.co.uk/travel/uk/2012835/british-airways-warning-flying-September,202fbb2084b44e48804c8bafac6a4334
"• Swedish performance EV marque Polestar’s next model is the 5 performance sedan
• New video shows some of the hot-weather testing Polestar 5 prototypes had to endure
• The Polestar 5 launches in 2025 with up to 884 hp

Polestar is nearing the end of the development road for its 5 performance sedan, which debuts later this year.

The automaker has been documenting the development via a video series on its official YouTube channel, and the latest video gives a glimpse at the hot-weather testing prototypes—and what their engineers had to endure.

The testing took place in the deserts of Dubai, where ambient temperatures can soar well above 105 degrees F, with cabin temperatures getting even higher. Ensuring a vehicle performs as expected under such extreme conditions requires extensive testing.

For urban environments, where cars experience tight turns, a lot of stopping and starting, and varying speeds, the engineers use a network of roads in an unfinished development known as the Half Desert, on the outskirts of Dubai. For testing of more spirited driving, they head out to the Jebel Jais mountain range.

The real challenge is ensuring the car and its key components remain cool in a consistent and efficient manner, and here software is playing an increasing role. Polestar said its software that controls the 5’s various cooling systems is able to recognize different driving styles and prioritize cooling accordingly.

The 5, a rival to the Porsche Taycan and high-end versions of the Tesla Model S, was first previewed in 2020 with Polestar’s Precept concept car, and camouflaged prototypes suggest the production version will stay true to the lines of the original show car. The car uses an aluminum platform developed in-house at Polestar, and in terms of performance, Polestar has said it is targeting up to 884 hp from a dual-motor all-wheel-drive powertrain.

The 5 was scheduled to be followed in 2026 by a 6 sports car using a shortened version of the 5’s platform, though Polestar in January said the 6 is being put on the back burner as the company focuses on a higher-volume 7 small SUV that is expected to arrive around 2027.",2025-02-11T12:00:00+00:00,https://mckinneynewssource.com/polestar-gives-glimpse-at-2026-5-sedans-hot-weather-testing/,889f8630043b4d94bc53dd1956112642
"Last Monday, I published “ D.C. Federal Judges Join the Resistance .” It focused on one D.C. federal district judge, Beryl Howell, who let her emotions get the better of any prudent legal judgment when she refused to implement the president’s direction to the attorney general to dismiss all pending indictments against Jan. 6 defendants “with prejudice.”

She first vented her spleen against the defendants and President Donald Trump (whom she accused of perpetrating a “ revisionist myth ”) in a wholly gratuitous screed about why the prosecutions were necessary and proper. She then finally admitted that she had no legal right to refuse to dismiss the case. But to show the president who was boss, she refused to dismiss the case with prejudice. That left open the potential for a refiling of the same charges. It was, of course, totally contrary to the president and DOJ’s clear intent.

In that same article, I pointed out that Judge Howell had company. Three of her rebellious colleagues in the D.C. district court also refused to dismiss pending J6 cases with prejudice — including one particularly confused opinion by anti-Trump Judge Tanya Chutkan.

The president entered his proclamation on Inauguration Day. I describe it more fully in “ D . C. Federal Judges Join the Resistance ,” but for present purposes, it is important to note that it pardoned persons who had been “ convicted of offenses related to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021” (emphasis added).

Defendants who had not yet been convicted did not receive a pardon. For them, the president directed the attorney general “to pursue dismissal with prejudice to the government of all pending indictments against individuals for their conduct related to the events at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021.” The attorney general complied by directing the Department of Justice to seek dismissals of the pending indictments “with prejudice” under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 48(a).

Tanya Chutkan may be the worst of the bunch. She has a reputation for overly harsh sentences for J6 defendants, even imprisoning defendants for whom the prosecutors had recommended no confinement. She has presided over other cases involving Trump. And, as Sen. Ted Cruz put it , she has a “reputation for being far left, even by D.C. District Court standards” and “is going to be relentlessly hostile to Donald Trump.”

But for our present purposes, Chutkan’s unsuitability to preside over complex cases related to the Trump administration is highlighted by her recent incoherent ruling in which she refused to dismiss charges against a J6 defendant with prejudice. That ruling evidences a lack of analytical ability that renders her unable to grasp basic legal concepts, although she does know how to throw in a scatological catchphrase guaranteed to attract media attention.

The case before Judge Chutkan was United States v. Banuelos . The defendant was not arrested for J6-related offenses until March 2024. By the time of Trump’s inauguration 10 months later, he had not been tried or convicted. Reportedly , he had a trial “tentatively scheduled” in February 2025. So John Banuelos was in the category of those untried, nonconvicted defendants for whom the president had instructed the attorney general “to pursue dismissal with prejudice.” The DOJ prosecutors complied by promptly moving for a dismissal of his indictment, with prejudice, pursuant to Federal Rule 48(a).

Judge Chutkan ruled on that motion on Jan. 22. She refused to dismiss the charges against Banuelos with prejudice. Her order is a mishmash of confusion, defiance, and intellectual incoherence.

First, Chutkan gave every appearance of being ignorant of the fundamentals of the legal matter before her. She did not understand the difference between a presidential pardon and a DOJ decision not to prosecute and to seek a Rule 48(a) dismissal. She opened her discussion with this gem:

The Government’s only stated reason for pursuing dismissal with prejudice is that the President, in addition to pardoning the Defendant, has ordered the Attorney General to do so.

No, Your Honor, no! There are several errors in just that one sentence. I will focus on just two.

First, the president did not pardon Banuelos. The clear language of the proclamation , which Chutkan cites in her order , grants pardons to “all other individuals convicted of offenses related to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021.” For defendants who had not been convicted, the president instead directed the attorney general to “pursue dismissal with prejudice to the government of all pending indictments.” And that is exactly what DOJ did by filing a Rule 48(a) motion to dismiss the indictment with prejudice.

Thus, because Banuelos had not been convicted, the presidential pardon did not extend to him. Chutkan’s contrary conclusion is inexplicable.

It is useful to note here that a pardon and a Rule 48(a) dismissal of an indictment with prejudice are not functionally the same thing. A pardon does not purge or erase a criminal conviction . It does not expunge the recipient’s criminal records. If a potential employer later asks a pardon recipient whether he has ever been convicted of a crime, he would be obligated to respond in the affirmative. If he had paid a fine to the U.S. Treasury as part of his punishment, a pardon would not give him the right to have the money refunded. 

In contrast, when an indictment is dismissed against a defendant who has never been convicted, he never pays a fine for the offense and has no criminal conviction on his record (at least for the offenses dismissed). So a Rule 48(a) dismissal is not the equivalent of a pardon, and confusing the two is a mistake of substance.

There is a second error in that one sentence that leads to another legal error. It also displays the intellectual incoherence in her order. Chutkan’s mistaken belief that the president pardoned Banuelos (“the President, in addition to  pardoning the Defendant….”) is totally inconsistent with her refusal to dismiss the case “with prejudice.” A pardon would prevent the case from ever being filed again. But Chutkan entered only a dismissal “without prejudice.” The charges are still hanging over the defendant’s head and can be refiled. The incoherence between this and Chutkan’s belief that Banuelos was pardoned is inexplicable except, perhaps, by a desire to spite either the president or the defendant (or both).

Not content with multiple errors in one sentence, the same paragraph of Judge Chutkan’s order contains another legal error. After claiming that the president pardoned Banuelos, she pronounced that the pardon “does not necessarily render ‘innocent’ a defendant of any alleged violation of the law.” Sorry, Judge, but Banuelos is a legally innocent man. You learned in law school that in our system of justice, all defendants are presumed innocent. They are not deemed guilty until an order of conviction has found them guilty. That principle may not apply in your court these days, but it remains the law of the land despite your implication to the contrary.

Possibly Chutkan was trying to make the point that the alleged pardon did not mean Banuelos did not commit the acts with which he was charged, that he was not “innocent” as a moral matter. That may be true, but, aside from the fact that this is not what she said, it is outside her role as a judge to comment on it. In their opinions and orders, judges are supposed to employ legal language to convey legal concepts, and the presumption of innocence is chief among them. Chutkan departed from that rule too.

In the penultimate paragraph of her discussion, Judge Chutkan cloaked this defendant with all the sins of any sort committed by all J6 actors. She said, “More broadly, no pardon can change the tragic truth of what happened on January 6, 2021.” There we go with the “pardon” language again. She then continued:

The dismissal of this case cannot undo the “rampage [that] left multiple people dead, injured more than 140 people, and inflicted millions of dollars in damage.”

This inflammatory rhetoric is not worthy of a United States district judge. How many “multiple people” did the “rampage” supposedly leave dead? Four people died that day. All were Trump supporters. Of these four, only one was killed. Ashli Babbitt, an unarmed Air Force veteran, was shot to death by a Capitol Police officer. The other three died from medical emergencies, including heart-related conditions and one accidental drug overdose.

Further, in a blatant piece of propaganda, the Capitol Police released a statement blaming the “rioters” for the death of Officer Brian D. Sicknick. As reported by CNN on Jan. 8, 2021 , the Capitol Police claimed Officer Sicknick “was injured while physically engaging with the rioters and collapsed after returning to his division office.” He supposedly was “taken to a local hospital where he succumbed to his injuries,” with those fatal injuries being “due to injuries sustained while on-duty.” It was all a lie. Officer Sicknick died from strokes on Jan. 7, and his death was determined to be from natural causes.

Chutkan’s statement that the Jan. 6 “rampage” left “multiple people dead” perpetuates these lies. She obviously intended to imply that the “rioters” caused these “multiple” deaths. Chutkan either was trying to mislead or simply didn’t know anything about the facts she was putting in her opinion. Sloppy or corrupt, take your pick.

Chutkan then concluded that dismissing the case “cannot whitewash the blood, feces, and terror that the mob left in its wake.” Did Banuelos have anything to do with that? Surely if he had, Judge Chutkan would have said so. But she did not. She was content to smear him by borrowing that snippet from another case. And if you dig down in the case she cited to identify the ultimate source for the quote, you will see it is none other than The New York Times .

As Chutkan surely knew and likely intended, the “blood, feces, and terror” snippet became a media favorite. See, for example, The Hill , MSN , CNN , CBS , and others.

The tempered approach taken by Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in provides a sharp contrast with the inflammatory approaches embraced by Judge Chutkan and some of her other rebellious colleagues. The defendant, Dominic Box, had been found guilty of “Parading, Demonstrating, or Picketing in a Capitol Building,” and similar charges after a trial in June 2024. But as of Jan. 20, 2025, there was no final conviction order entered yet because Box was not scheduled to be sentenced until Feb. 21.

After a sound analysis of the propriety of entering a Rule 48(a) dismissal under these circumstances, Judge Kollar-Kotelly turned to the propriety of the requested dismissal with prejudice in view of the defendant’s established guilt and all that had occurred at the Capitol. She disposed of that in three sentences:

Here, the Government’s only stated reason for pursuing dismissal with prejudice is that the President has ordered the Attorney General to do so. The Court does not discern — and neither party has identified — any defect in either the legal merits of, or the factual basis for, the Government’s case that would require dismissal. See United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 693 (1974). (internal citation omitted)

She then dismissed the case with prejudice.

The president’s authority was absolute, so no “further explanation” was required or appropriate. Judge Kollar-Kotelly’s colleagues on the bench could learn from her.

Following the publication of “ D.C. Federal Judges Join the Resistance ,” I have seen a number of comments suggesting various remedies, the most humane of which were complaints to the D.C. Bar or impeachment. As a practical matter, success with the former is unlikely. As for impeachment, it would be quite time-consuming, and Congress has bigger fish to fry.

But I do have a modest suggestion the DOJ should consider.

The Democrats and their allies have made it abundantly clear that they are going to continue their lawfare. They are going to file suits nationwide in cherry-picked venues to try to thwart the administration’s entire agenda. Executive orders, laws passed by Congress, agency actions, employee terminations, attacks on fraud waste and mismanagement — everything this administration tries to do will be litigated. Many of these suits will be filed in Washington, D.C., where some will be assigned to Judge Chutkan. DOJ should pull out all the stops and make a sustained effort to disqualify Chutkan from any cases involving the administration on the grounds that she has demonstrated such a bias against it that she should be disqualified from hearing any other cases involving the administration.

In my opinion, Chutkan’s bias is evident from the approach and language used in her order and from the simple fact that she refused what should have been a routine request to dismiss these prosecutions with prejudice as DOJ had suggested. DOJ may conclude that the same rationale necessitates the disqualification of Judge Howell and perhaps other judges also. I defer to it.

This is an envelope worth pushing. And when Judge Chutkan predictably refuses to recuse herself, DOJ should keep the pressure on and appeal, including to the Supreme Court if necessary.

"Τον επόμενο μήνα, στο πλαίσιο των εορτασμών για την 204η επέτειο απ’ την κήρυξη της Επανάστασης του 1821 στην Αγία Λαύρα και την Απελευθέρωση της πόλης των Καλαβρύτων, ο Δήμος Καλαβρύτων και ο Δήμος της πόλης Ντολόρες Ιδάλγο της Πολιτείας Γουαναχουάτο του Μεξικού θ’ αδελφοποιηθούν σε τελετή που θα φιλοξενηθεί στο Πολυδύναμο Πολιτιστικό Κέντρο του Δήμου Καλαβρύτων.
Η τελετή αδελφοποίησης θα γίνει το Σάββατο 22 Μαρτίου στις 12 το μεσημέρι, παρουσία του Πρέσβη του Μεξικού στην Ελλάδα και αντιπροσωπείας του ιστορικού Δήμου Ντολόρες Ιδάλγο.
Όπως είναι γνωστό τα Καλάβρυτα και η ιστορική πόλη του Μεξικού συνδέονται με ταυτόσημες ιστορικές διαδρομές και σημαίνοντα ρόλο στην κήρυξη της ανεξαρτησίας των δυο χώρων.
Και αυτό γιατί, στο Μεξικό, στην πόλη Ντολόρες Ιντάλγο το 1810, ο ιερέας Μιγκέλ Ιντάλγο χτυπώντας την καμπάνα στον Ιερό Ναό της πόλης έδωσε συμβολικά το έναυσμα του Αγώνα της Ανεξαρτησίας κατά της ισπανικής Κατοχής. Ο ιερέας υπήρξε ηρωική μορφή με δεσπόζουσα θέση στη Μεξικανική Ιστορία. Το Μεξικό τελικά κατάφερε το 1821 να πετύχει την Ανεξαρτησία του.
Την ίδια χρονιά ένας άλλος φλογερός ιερωμένος, ο Παλαιών Πατρών Γερμανός, ύψωνε στην Αγία Λαύρα το Λάβαρο του Αγώνα της Ανεξαρτησίας των Ελλήνων κατά των Τούρκων. Δίνοντας το σύνθημα της Επανάστασης και της Απελευθέρωσης μετά από 400 χρόνια υποδούλωσης.
«Είναι αυτή η συμβολική σύνδεση που έρχεται να φέρει κοντά τα Καλάβρυτα κι όλη την Ελλάδα με το Μεξικό. Πριν από 204 χρόνια οι δυο χώρες μας, με κοινή αφετηρία τα ιδανικά της Ελευθερίας, της Πίστης, της Αυτοδιάθεσης και της Προόδου, κατάφεραν να υπερισχύσουν πολύ ισχυρότερων δυνάμεων της εποχής. Πάνω σ’ αυτή τη ταυτόσημη ιστορική διαδρομή και με γνώμονα τους παραδοσιακούς δεσμούς φιλίας με το Μεξικό, οικοδομούμε μια νέα σχέση η οποία επικυρώνεται, πλέον, και μέσω της αδελφοποίησης τον ερχόμενο Μάρτιο», αναφέρει σε δήλωση του ο Δήμαρχος Καλαβρύτων Θανάσης Παπαδόπουλος.
Τα Δημοτικά Συμβούλια των Καλαβρύτων και του Δήμου Ντολόρες Ιντάλγο -πόλη αφιερωμένη στον Μιγκέλ Ιντάλγο- έχουν ήδη πάρει ομόφωνες αποφάσεις αδελφοποίησης των δυο πόλεων. Να σημειωθεί ακόμα ότι ο Δήμος Ντολόρες Ιντάλγο βρίσκεται στα βόρεια και κεντρικά της χώρας του Μεξικού και έχει πληθυσμό -στην απογραφή του 2010- κοντά 150.000 κατοίκους. Η δε έδρα του Δήμου έχει πληθυσμό 59.000 κατοίκων.
Τέλος, τον περασμένο Σεπτέμβριο, στο πλαίσιο του εορτασμού για την συμπλήρωση των 85 χρόνων διπλωματικών σχέσεων ανάμεσα στην Ελλάδα και στο Μεξικό φιλοξενήθηκε στα Καλάβρυτα έκθεση ζωγραφικής η οποία περιλάμβανε δημιουργίες 27 παιδιών -ηλικίας 7 έως 12 ετών- από σχολεία της Κρήτης και της Μύκονου, με θέμα την διεθνούς φήμης και αναγνώρισης Μεξικανή ζωγράφο Φρίντα Κάλο.

"N-able, Inc. (NYSE: NABL), a global software company helping IT services providers deliver security, data protection as-a-service, and unified endpoint management, today announced a success story of its partner Ventnor City, New Jersey in its ability to effectively thwart a cyberattack within hours of engaging the Adlumin Managed Detection and Response (MDR) solution—an N-able product.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250211858995/en/

Recently, Ventnor City chose N-able solutions N-sight, Adlumin MDR, Cove Data Protection, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), and more to help secure and protect their IT infrastructure. This includes several local institutions spread across eight different locations and consisting of approximately 200 endpoints. Adlumin MDR was instrumental in identifying threats.

“I can confidently say that MDR proved its value within the first six hours of deployment,” said James E Pacanowski II, CGCIO/Network Administrator, City of Ventnor. “We received alerts that our police department was being hit thousands of times by somebody. Thanks to N-able, the MDR solution notified us immediately and we isolated the workstation before the intruders were able to get into our network and do any damage.”

Adlumin MDR equips organizations with everything they need to stop advanced cyber threats, reduce vulnerabilities, and strengthen their security posture. The solution integrates with and ingests data from existing security, using artificial intelligence to detect threats that might otherwise go unnoticed. With both automated and human response capabilities, it goes beyond simply alerting to ensure threats are swiftly and effectively mitigated.

“The level of protection that Adlumin MDR can add for any organization is a value on its own,” said Troels Rasmussen, General Manager of Security Products at N-able. “Amid escalating threats, expanding regulations, and persistent staffing challenges, state and local organizations face unprecedented cyber alert fatigue. This solution provides the essential support they need to stay resilient.”

Antivirus and firewalls are often not enough protection. Modern criminals frequently use multiple methods of attack, which is why N‑able offers a range of security layers to help you stay protected.

Pacanowski continues, “It makes it a lot easier for me that I do not have to run around and jump through hoops knowing that there is somebody monitoring 24/7, because that phone call came at 3:30 in the morning and that particular workstation was isolated. So, knowing that there's somebody 24/7 monitoring what's going on with my system has made things a whole lot easier for me.”

"The Public Prosecution has detained the chairman of the Waha Oil Company’s Management Committee on charges of profiteering and abuse of power, in a case involving millions of dollars in allegedly fraudulent contracts.

According to a statement from the Public Prosecutor’s Office, the official is accused of securing illicit financial gains for himself and others through questionable contracts related to operations at the Sidra Port and the Dhahra oil field. One of the contracts, for constructing wave barriers at Sidra Port, was reportedly signed for 769 million Libyan dinars—more than double the 339 million dinar bid offered by a competing company.

Further allegations suggest the chairman assigned oil field rehabilitation projects to a company established in 2022, despite its lack of relevant expertise, disbursing $140 million over two years. Additionally, he is accused of authorizing $100 million in payments to another company contracted to drill oil wells, without any actual work being completed.

Investigators are also examining reports of inflated housing contracts for employees and adjustments to service contracts totaling millions of dollars. After interrogating the accused, the Public Prosecution ordered his pretrial detention and has initiated measures to pursue other individuals implicated in the case. Authorities have also suspended the contested contracts and ordered a comprehensive review through the Audit Bureau and industry experts.",2025-02-11T12:25:23+00:00,https://libyaobserver.ly/news/libyan-oil-executive-detained-over-multi-million-dollar-corruption-allegations,dea042115f4244d89d2ae24d11354230
"MILWAUKEE — Milwaukee Bucks general manager Jon Horst said trading Khris Middleton was the toughest decision of his career because of everything the three-time All-Star had done for the franchise.

“I’m incredibly close with Khris personally, his family,” Horst said before the Bucks' 125-111 loss to the Golden State Warriors on Monday, his first time addressing reporters since the trade was completed last week. “I probably have more Middleton jerseys in my house than anything and will still have more Middleton jerseys in my house than anything.”

Trading Middleton to the Washington Wizards brought forward Kyle Kuzma to Milwaukee and put the Bucks under the second salary-cap apron, giving them the flexibility to make other moves during the offseason. The Bucks entered Monday fifth in the Eastern Conference standings.

Horst said getting under the second apron wasn’t a primary concern for the Bucks. He said he believes the moves he made last week should make Milwaukee more dangerous this season, adding that ownership didn’t ask him to lower the payroll.

“They’ve done nothing but resource this team and want to win,” said Horst, Milwaukee's general manager since 2017. “Their only mandate is, ‘We want to win this year. What do we do to try to win this year?’ And we believe that this gives us a better chance to win this year. It happens to also put us under the second apron, which gives us some benefits going forward.”

Milwaukee’s other trades included acquiring Kevin Porter Jr. from the Los Angeles Clippers for MarJon Beauchamp and getting center Jericho Sims from the New York Knicks for guard Delon Wright. The trades also left them with one open roster spot.

The biggest move sent one of the most accomplished players in Bucks history out of town.

Middleton is the Bucks’ career leader in 3-pointers (1,382) and ranks behind only two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo in games (735) and minutes (23,039). He's third in franchise history in points (12,586) and assists (2,990), and he helped lead the Bucks to their first title in 50 years in the 2020-21 season.

“It has to be the hardest thing transactionally that I’ve ever done, from the human side of it, the roster side of it, the culture of the team, our community,” Horst said.

Horst said he didn't consult with Antetokounmpo about the trade. Antetokounmpo referred to Middleton as a brother but said he understood the business side of the move.

“I’m willing to live with him either agreeing or disagreeing with it and whatever the aftermath of that is because it’s my job,” Horst said. “And this time around it wasn’t the right thing to talk to him about it. And I also have not talked to him about it afterwards yet. Don’t need to. ... It’s a business and my job’s really hard a few times a year. His job’s really hard every night.”

The 33-year-old Middleton played in just 33 games in 2022-23 and 55 in 2023-24. He didn’t make his 2024-25 debut until Dec. 6 as he recovered from offseason surgery to each of his ankles. His scoring average of 12.6 points is his lowest since 2013-14.

Horst said Middleton’s health played only a “minimal factor” in his thought process at the deadline.

“So for me, it wasn’t a zero factor,” Horst said. “It’s part of it. It’s part of the calculus, but very little for me, personally.”

The Bucks also sent 2024 first-round pick AJ Johnson to Washington. The trade also included draft compensation for both teams.

Horst said he believes the Bucks improved by getting deeper at the spots they needed to address. Kuzma brings versatility, with the ability to play at least four positions on offense and three on defense.

“He just plays with a pace and a speed and athleticism that we think will really help us against the teams we have to beat in the playoffs,” Horst said.

The 29-year-old Kuzma is shooting 41.6% overall, 28.2% from 3-point range and 60.8% on free throws — all career lows. Horst noted that other players have improved their percentages once they get to Milwaukee and get better shots from playing alongside Antetokounmpo. He believes Porter also can become more efficient.

Porter pleaded guilty in January 2024 to misdemeanor assault and a harassment violation in connection with a September 2023 incident at a Manhattan hotel. Prosecutors said Porter attacked his girlfriend, leaving her covered in blood with a deep cut above her right eye. The woman disputed that account and accused prosecutors of pushing a “false narrative.”

“I think we have taken bets in the past and brought people into a culture with great veterans ... and we feel like we’ve helped people,” Horst said. “I think we have an opportunity to help Kevin Porter continue on the path of what he’s on, which is improving and growing. There’s no question that if he does that, we think he can help us.”",2025-02-11T12:16:00+00:00,https://spectrumnews1.com/wi/milwaukee/news/2025/02/11/bucks--middleton-trade--jon-horst,128fe0c4ac6c4a5e9a54e6747afb5d90

"The Cabinet of Ministers has approved the implementation of a new Employee Provident Fund (EPF) Management System to improve efficiency in handling Sri Lanka’s largest pension fund.

With 21.5 million member accounts and 77,000 active employers, the EPF has assets totaling Rs. 4.2 trillion as of October 2024, maintaining an annual growth rate of over 9% in recent years.

Given the increasing volume of transactions, the need for a modern IT system capable of managing large-scale data efficiently was identified, the government said.

In 2021, a project was launched under the World Bank’s Financial Sector Modernization Project to develop the new system. The planning and specifications were completed with the consultancy of PricewaterhouseCoopers India.

Subsequently, the Cabinet has now approved a proposal by the President, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development, to select an integrator for the system’s implementation.

"KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 11 (Bernama) -- Johor Darul Ta’zim’s (JDT) new defensive signing Alvaro Gonzalez scored two goals to give them a 2-1 victory over Australian side Central Coast Mariners and put the Southern Tigers one step closer to the knockout stage of the 2024/25 Asian Champions League Elite (ACLE). In the match held at Industree Group Stadium in Gosford, Australia, Hector Bidoglio’s men displayed an energetic performance from the start, creating more chances than the home team. Relentless attacking pressure forced Central Coast Mariners goalkeeper Dylan Peraic Cullen into a crucial mistake at the end of the first half when he fouled Malaysia’s prolific forward, Arif Aiman Mohd Hanapi, who was through on goal.

Following a VAR (Video Assistant Referee) review, the referee decided to send Dylan Peraic off for denying Arif Aiman a clear goalscoring opportunity, leaving the hosts a man down. JDT were awarded a free kick from the incident, and Bergson Da Silva found the net after reacting quickly to Heberty’s shot, which had struck the post. However, the goal was disallowed after a VAR review confirmed Bergson was offside. Early in the second half, Bergson came close again in the 50th minute, but his shot was denied by Central Coast Mariners' substitute goalkeeper Adam Pavlesic.

JDT’s breakthrough finally came in the 64th minute, when Alvaro calmly slotted home Arif Aiman’s cross, marking his first goal for the club. However, their lead was short-lived as Central Coast Mariners substitute Alou Kuol equalised just six minutes later. JDT’s winner came in the 79th minute, with Alvaro once again scoring, this time connecting a powerful header from Heberty’s cross to give the Malaysian champions a 2-1 win.

The win earned JDT three points to climb to fifth place in the East Zone group, which has 12 teams. The Southern Tigers will next host South Korean club Pohang Steelers at Stadium Sultan Ibrahim on Feb 19 for their final group match. Only the top eight teams after eight league-stage matches will progress to the Round of 16.",2025-02-11T12:16:47+00:00,https://www.bernama.com/tv/news.php?id=2391540,1a573a83c7574603bf009f288403d028
"An environmental group of volunteers aimed at looking after the biodiversity of Mijas beaches is being set up at La Cala de Mijas on the morning of Saturday, February 15.

The Fundación Aula del Mar Mediterráneo has struck an agreement with Mijas Council to form Creamar Mijas, who are signing up local volunteers and holding a training day to gain the necessary skills to carry out environmental actions in the marine and shoreline of Mijas Costa.

They will be carrying out public awareness campaigns and more direct action to restore marine and coastal ecosystems and bringing the community together, both Spanish and foreign, to help conserve the uniqueness of the natural Mijas biodiversity in the face of increasing tourism and other threats it faces.

‘For us, the care of our seabed and coastline is something fundamental, since we have a biodiversity that is invaluable. That’s why setting up the Creamar group is a great step to continue preserving our coast and those submerged forests,’ the Councillor for the Environment, Marco Cortés, explained.

On Saturday, February 15, from 11am to 1pm at the Cultural Centre in La Cala, the Fundación Aula del Mar Mediterráneo will be holding an introductory talk, followed by the setting up of the Creamar group with some concrete first steps people can join in with.

The seabed of the coast of Mijas is quite unique in the area, as it has meadows of posidonia, a plant of incalculable value responsible for producing enormous quantities of oxygen and, at the same time, cleaning the sea waters. It is an aquatic plant with characteristics similar to terrestrial ones, with roots, stems and leaves up to a metre long, and serves as a guarantee for biodiversity. In fact, Mijas is listed as a Special Conservation Area for this flora. It is a space between Calahonda and the Calaburras Lighthouse, which works out as more than 1,400 hectares of surface of the seabed.

Any person over 18 and resident close to the beaches on which they are going to act can be part of the group and has time available to participate in the activities as well. Applications to join can be made by sending an email to voluntariado@auladelmarmed.org or by leaving a WhatsApp message on 690 288 167.",2025-02-11T12:13:22+00:00,https://euroweeklynews.com/2025/02/11/creamar-looking-for-volunteers-to-care-for-mijas-coastline/,127520736a4b411eb3bdc15a7b3b9b13
"Ally’s Acca Champions League Boost: Get Walsall, Charlton, Juventus and Real Madrid to win NOW 16/1

Our very own Ally McCoist has made his talkSPORT BET tips on the action across Tuesday night's fixtures in the Champions League and EFL action!

Ally's Acca: Walsall, Charlton, Juventus and Real Madrid all to win - was 13/1 NOW 16/1 - CLAIM HERE

Walsall still lead League Two by six points - despite losing three of their last four giving semblance of hopes to the likes of Notts County, Doncaster and Bradford.

However, they'll surely get back to winning ways against struggling Gillingham, who sit in 19th place also on a poor run of form: losing each of their last two, winless in their last nine.

Charlton have had a great run of form with four wins from five and are now firmly in contention for a play-off spot if they continue.

They should do too up against the Posh who are now flirting with a relegation battle.

Onto the Champions League, there's some cracking European fixtures this week with the standout clearly Man City vs Real Madrid.

These two sides have traded blows almost evenly over the last few years often meeting in the late stages of the UCL.

But given how Man City are still not quite back to the kind of side they have been, winning the UCL and Premier League for instance, it's Real Madrid's to win considering they look a dangerous attacking side that can punish City's lack of defensive cohesion.

Juventus face Dutch side PSV tonight - though the visitors have the better form, finished higher they have to be the away side in the play-offs.

Juventus were surprisingly poor in the UCL this year but they still only lost twice.

They have the players and the home advantage tonight that certainly have the ability to put in a solid performance to beat PSV who have hit a bit of a rough patch in the Eredivisie - winning just once in their last five.

"Two men were arrested for possession of whoonga capsules and cocaine worth R160 000 during a roadblock at the Umvoti Toll Plaza last Saturday.

A 29-year-old man, caught with whoonga capsules, was a passenger in a taxi. When the taxi was stopped, he jumped out and ran into Thembeni township.

Police, assisted by residents, pursued and found him hiding in a house, whose owners reportedly did not know him.

Officers found 2 800 red and white whoonga capsules on him. Later, police searched a vehicle and discovered cocaine powder, leading to the arrest of the 30-year-old driver.

Both men are to appear in the KwaDukuza Magistrates’ Court.

He said while some residents see them as an inconvenience, he noted that they are crucial in keeping drugs off the streets and protecting the youth.

“The Provincial Commissioner’s Drug Desk plan is clear in its intent to eradicate narcotics from the province. The iLembe District is fully committed to implementing this strategy through ongoing operations. For a thriving economy, we need a healthy society and drugs have no place in that formula. Every effort will be made to seize illegal substances and arrest those involved in drug distribution,” said Gopaul.

"Dricus du Plessis had better think again if he has designs on challenging Alex Pereira for the UFC’s 205-pound title, according to the champ.

The South African underscored his status as the best 185-pound fighter in the world with a comprehensive decision win over Sean Strickland in the UFC 312 main event in Sydney, Australia over the weekend, meaning that Du Plessis has now defeated former middleweight champions in each of his past four bouts in the UFC cage (Strickland x2, Israel Adesnya, Robert Whittaker).

Speaking post-fight, Du Plessis heavily suggested that the unbeaten 185-pound contender Khamzat Chimaev should be the next man up for him — but added that he is also interested in pursuing a bout with the 205-pound champion Pereira who previously held the middleweight championship that now adorns DDP’s mantle.

But after news that Du Plessis has Pereira in his crosshairs reached the Brazilian, he had a simple message for the champ: be careful what you wish for.

“In the Octagon, he calls out Alex Pereira,” UFC commentator Daniel Cormier said on his personal YouTube channel, as noted by MMA Fighting.

“I told Pereira after the fight, I go, ‘He wants you, Pereira.’ Pereira goes, ‘He’s just too small.’ Seriously. Pereira goes, ‘This man is just too small.’”

Cormier added that as dominant a fighter as Du Plessis is, there is one notable challenge that remains in the former of Chimaev.

“Alex is huge though,” Cormier said. “He looked massive compared to Dricus. And I love that Dricus has these big goals, I just think he has work to do at middleweight before he starts thinking about going up — Khamzat Chimaev being problem number one.",2025-02-11T12:19:08+00:00,https://themaclife.com/sports/mma/ddp-too-small-to-challenge-for-light-heavyweight-title-claims-pereira/,22b7d60a00fd4a3d8ab622294ab13428

"Finance chief set to go days after crunch budget vote

Dudley Council leader says interim finance chief has done his hard work but opposition unhappy about top jobs for interim executives

Dudley Council looks set for more changes at the top with the expected departure of its senior finance officer. Although yet to be officially confirmed, sources inside the authority say Brendan Arnold, the current interim chief finance officer, will leave his role at the end of February.

The top finance job, referred to as the section 151 officer, is one of the three most important executive roles in local government along with the senior legal officer and chief executive – the three jobs are called ‘The Golden Triangle’. If Mr Arnold leaves when expected, his own Linkedin social media account says he is ‘presently on assignment until late February 2025’, he will be going just days after a crunch meeting when councillors could have approved savings of £42m for the next financial year.

Dudley’s leader, Conservative Cllr Patrick Harley, said: “The Interim 151 officer is as it states – “interim “. “During that time he has spent with us we have worked to increase reserves by £30m over next five years, balanced the budget not just for this year but until 2030 and introduced guiding principles for revenue and capital budget setting.

“Therefore, the hard work to ensure all this progress is not wasted and lost will need to be completed by the individual departments, directors, and cabinet members. “The hard work for the 151 officer is complete and now the operational part of the budget becomes the work of the rest of the council.”

All of Dudley’s golden triangle jobs are currently held by interim officers; a situation which worries the Labour opposition. Dudley’s Labour group leader, Cllr Pete Lowe, said: “It’s not very golden if there is nobody there to find the gold at the end.

"As the Online Safety Act begins its phased implementation, the UK government claims the legislation will create a safer digital world for children. While well intended, in reality, the OSA will likely do the opposite.

The legislation is fundamentally flawed – introducing loopholes that children will easily exploit while simultaneously threatening free speech and burdening small online communities with disproportionate liabilities. As we mark Safer Internet Day, it’s important that we understand the consequences of the dangerously flawed new law.

One of the most touted aspects of the Online Safety Act is the mandatory age verification for sites hosting adult content. Yet, this measure is doomed to fail. VPNs, proxy services, adult sites outside of the UK, and the dark web all allow minors to effortlessly bypass the OSA restrictions. Even worse, the OSA restrictions are likely to effectively encourage minors to use sites far more dangerous than those hosted in the UK.

The very users the OSA seeks to protect – the tech-savvy younger generation – will be the first to find their way around it. However, what is even more concerning is that the youngest and most vulnerable users, those too young to understand or bypass these measures, will still be at risk.

Pre-teens, who should be better protected by any online safety legislation, will remain unprotected as easily available adult material continues to filter down. Just as we saw with previous attempts to regulate online content, younger children will still stumble across harmful material, if not be directed to dangerous venues like the dark web via their peers – despite the false sense of protection that comes with the OSA.

On the flip-side, OSA puts adults at risk as they must provide personal data, and at times biometric information, to parties to whom they have no prior relationship and whose security practices are as of yet, effectively untested.

Besides the obvious risk of attackers stealing data from the age verification (AV) providers, there is little doubt that cyber criminals will take advantage of the situation by setting up phishing sites that impersonate AV services. We saw how well criminals impersonated fake parcel delivery services during Covid and how many billions of dollars have been lost to phishing attacks over the years – why give them another opportunity to employ these ruthless tactics against innocent people?

This is, after all, a dynamic already scripted by other restrictive measures, from online gambling bans to restrictions on pirated content. When it comes to online access, determined users always find workarounds; minors being no exception. The illusion of safety created by these age verification mandates does not translate into real world protection. While parents will be lulled into a false sense of security, their children will be left exposed whilst accessing dangerous, and potentially illegal, content.

Perhaps even more concerning is the overreach of this legislation. This law does not just apply to major platforms like Facebook, but extends to any platform that facilitates user-to-user engagement – including small community forums, hobbyist groups, and even local church discussion boards. This means that countless website owners and moderators, including those who are working for organisations dedicated to protecting children, who have no legal teams or compliance departments, will suddenly find themselves potentially facing massive multi-million-pound fines.

Many wonderful organisations, and providers of valuable information and services to they community at large may be forced to cease operations out of a fear of unintentionally violating the Act. All of this damage will occur whilst the threats to minors continue to exist – if not become worse.

Sadly, this is already happening.

Take, for example, the LFGSS, a completely benign, child-friendly community cycling forum, which is closing down due to the overwhelming burden placed on it by the Online Safety Act. If a discussion board for bike enthusiasts is at risk, how many other small communities will vanish for nothing?

This is not just speculation – it is already happening. Many small forums, church groups, and niche online communities may face the same fate and be forced to close rather than take on the high costs of compliance with the OSA – costs that can be prohibitive for small operators even if OSA was intended to target only Silicon Valley giants and platforms hosting adult content. This could disproportionately impact hundreds of thousands of perfectly benign websites in the UK.

If the goal is truly to protect children, there are far more effective and proportionate solutions: filtering and device-level checks. Instead of placing the burden on individual websites, parents should keep control of what their children access online. Parental control software, operating system-level restrictions, and internet service provider-level filtering are vastly superior and precise compared to the blunt instrument of the Online Safety Act and the best efforts of Ofcom – the designated regulator that, despite considerable expenditure, simply doesn’t have the tools for the job.

In addition to filtering, device-level checks represent yet another much safer and much more effective way to protect minors from other threats, such as communications from would-be-abusers or the like, by setting their device to deliver an age-appropriate online experience. This can be achieved without the need for any sensitive information to be divulged throughout the web, whilst shielding minors from content deemed for adults.

By shifting responsibility to individual websites instead of empowering parents, guardians and minors, the path currently chosen by the government is ineffective, worse than the cure that it purports to provide, and exposes internet users to dangers.

Governments that support any such age verification mandates are setting themselves up for a risky political gamble. The OSA is not a step forward; it’s a dangerous misstep destined to fail.

The unintended consequences of the OSA will soon become apparent: minors will still access harmful content; perfectly benign online forums will disappear; precious sensitive data will be disseminated throughout the web and exposed; and free speech will be eroded and the most dangerous online risks to minors. Such as communications from would-be abusers in their physical locations, access to illegal drugs and weapons sold via the dark web, and recruitment attempts by extremist groups, will remain completely unaddressed.

While the OSA may give elected officials bragging rights that they are protecting children, the law – and those supporting it – are, in reality, making the internet more dangerous for the children of the United Kingdom.",2025-02-11T11:50:09+00:00,https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/online-safety-act-labour-safer-internet-day-b2695966.html,f4ce718887524ac79efd501d7566f5a6

"It’s no secret that the price of land in Luxembourg plays a key role in the high level of housing prices. As a small country, land is scarce, and anything scarce is expensive. But the Housing Observatory has just demonstrated this--with figures to back it up--in its on land prices.

To arrive at this observation, the Housing Observatory has set up a hedonic model that makes it possible to establish an index of building land prices tracking changes in the value of these plots while neutralising changes in the composition of transactions from one year to the next.

The model shows that the price per acre of a plot of land is influenced by three main variables:

- the intrinsic qualities of the plot. For example, a plot shaped like a square or circle will be worth more than a long rectangle; the larger the surface area, the cheaper the are; and if the plot is a Baulücke (in-fill), it will be worth more;

- information from the general development plan (plan d’aménagement général, PAG). A plot in HAB II (collective housing) is worth more than in HAB I (single-family home), for example;

- the date of the transaction, as the price per are has risen sharply over time.

To this must be added the location of the plot and its distance from Luxembourg City, with the journey time to the capital being an important factor.

Once these sale prices have been modelled, it is possible to quantify the differences between communes if the same plot were sold, leading to the development of groups of communes with similar prices. This shows that the median price of a plot of land in Luxembourg over the period 2020-2022 is €304,279. In the north, it is €49,743, six times less expensive.

If we compare these results with , we can see that the spatial structure of building land prices and that of housing prices and advertised rents are very similar. However, the price ratio is not of the same magnitude, since the swing is “only” 1 to 2 for house prices. Nevertheless, the figures in this study confirm that land is the main driver of price differences between municipalities on the residential property market.

"TRANSNET National Ports Authority has signed two terminal operator agreements for South Africa’s first LNG import terminal.

TNPA, which operates South Africa’s major seaports, confirmed that the terminal would be built at the port of Richards Bay, just north of Durban on the Indian Ocean coast.

The authority has signed a terminal operator agreement with Zululand Energy Terminal to design, finance, build and operate the LNG terminal over a 25-year period.

TNPA chair Andile Sangqu said the terminal was a response to the country’s energy supply challenges.

“By enabling the importation of liquefied natural gas, we are promoting the development of a sustainable source of energy to meet limited and depleting gas supplies,” he said.

Another TNPA board member, Tshokolo Nchocho, said: “By modernising existing infrastructure, this project not only enhances maritime fuel services but also plays a critical role in supporting global shipping operations, ensuring efficiency and competitiveness in an evolving energy landscape.”

Royal Vopak, which owns Zululand Energy Terminal with Transnet Pipeline, said phase one of the project would involve a floating storage unit with a capacity of 135,000 cu m-174,000 cu m. That will be replaced in phase two by an onshore storage tank, which will have a capacity of up to 220,000 cu m.

A final investment decision on the terminal is expected in 2026, but is contingent on “timely customer commitments”, Royal Vopak said.

Alongside the LNG terminal, TNPA has signed a 25-year concession with FFS Tank Terminals for the development and operation of a liquid bulk terminal specialising in bunker fuels at Richards Bay.",2025-02-11T12:24:01+00:00,https://www.lloydslist.com/LL1152539/South-Africa-signs-operator-agreement-for-first-LNG-terminal,f02172336e50473fa3e426052cc1d7a2
"A couple who ""never lost hope"" after the theft of their dog more than seven years ago said they were grateful to be together again. Daisy, Labrador, was abducted by her garden in Norfolk, Britain in November 2017, causing a disturbance to the couple who grew up, but also calls to the press and a request for assistance to the government. An RSPCA manager, the largest animal organization in Britain, found Daisy 13 miles away from her home in Somerset during a routine research last Sunday.

"We recently rode the 2025 Simple One electric scooter in Bengaluru. Although the brand has been around for a couple of years, its product, the One electric scooter, debuted after a hiatus. Here is what we think about it.

On the design front, the Simple One electric scooter looks quite modern and sporty. It should entice younger buyers who want a contemporary design. However, one can’t overlook the fact that it looks similar to the Ather 450X.

Two battery packs power the Simple One: a 3.7kWh floor-mounted unit and a portable 1.3kWh pack. The setup is linked to an 8.5kW motor that offers the Simple One a top speed of 105kmph. Simple claims its scooter has a maximum range of 248km.

In terms of features, the Simple One gets LED illumination, a touchscreen dashboard, TPMS, Park Assist, Find My Vehicle, customizable dash themes, rapid brake, OTA updates, trip history and statistics, a USB charging port, and updated regenerative braking.

While the overall quality seems decent, we feel some panel fitments could’ve been better. For reference, the console doesn’t sit flush with the plastic around it.

It also gets four ride modes - Eco, Ride, Dash, and Sonic. We rode the Simple One in Dash and Sonic for the most part and noticed the throttle response to be lively. Its response to the input was executed with swiftness and without any lag.

Even in terms of handling, the Simple One is quite impressive. It feels planted and responds to direction changes quickly. The suspension setup is taut but with a balance of comfort.

But should you spend Rs. 1.66 lakh (ex-showroom) on the Simple One electric scooter? We recommend you read our first ride review to get the answer.",2025-02-11T12:05:55+00:00,https://www.bikewale.com/news/simple-one-electric-scooter-review-image-gallery/,04c17cc29df0451abbc379e4372eebde

Vikramarka assured that the government is prepared to recruit more staff and allocate necessary funds to enhance the technical capabilities within the power sector, ensuring better service delivery.

The Deputy CM also reviewed the inventory and supply chain readiness with Chief Engineers from various departments. The review included an evaluation of steps taken over the past year to reduce power-related complaints.

"The Nigerian Railway Corporation, NRC, and APM Terminals, APMT, in the Apapa Ports area have officially relaunched cargo movement on the Standard Gauge Railway line from the ports in Lagos to Moniya, Ibadan freight yard, in Oyo State to boost import and export .

The Managing Director of the Nigerian Railway Corporation, NRC, Dr. Kayode Opeifa, who highlighted the long standing relationship between the NRC and the APM terminals in facilitating container movements across Nigeria, particularly to inland locations like Kaduna and Kano, said the new operation marks a significant improvement from the narrow guage network.

Dr. Opeifa, noted that available record showed that NRC moved 362,327 tonnage of containers, both import and export, in and out of the APM terminals both on the standard and narrow gauges in 2024.

The NRC boss said the new operations on the Standard Guage line would facilitate import and export of commodities with adequate convenience and hitch-free vehicle movement on the highways.

“NRC and APMT have long history of doing business of container traffic to places in the hinterland of Nigeria such as Kaduna, Kano, but it is mainly on the Narrow Gauge lines.

“However, container traffic movement by rail on the standard gauge in and out of APMT to Moniya freight yard in Ibadan commenced in September 2023, with the likes of Bueno Logistics and Transco Africa Logistics, blazing the trail among other customers using the single “transitional line” in APMT.

“Two additional lines are at advanced stage of completion in APMT which will bring the total lines within APMT standard gauge corridor to three,” he said.

Dr. Opeifa, reiterated the Federal Government’s commitment to modernizing the country’s rail infrastructure in line with President Bola Tinubu’s vision for the sector.

Earlier at the occasion, the Chief Commercial Officer of APM terminals, Mrs Caroline Aubert-Adewuyi, said the rail service would reduce operational costs associated with high logistics by road.

The Chief Commercial Officer of APMT, said the new schedule would ensure that train operates three times in a week, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

“This initiative symbolise the collective efforts of all stakeholders who worked diligently to provide Nigerian shippers with viable alternatives to road transportation for cargo evacuation from the Apapa port.

“Apapa’s enduring strength lies in its multi-modal transportation capabilities, seamlessly integrating barge, road, and rail systems.

“This robust infrastructure enables efficient cargo handling and evacuation from the port.

“The results from our 2024 fiscal year reflect this efficiency, with our export volumes growing 43 per cent over the last two years, when this accelerated process began at the end of 2022,” she said.

Also, the Executive Secretary, Nigerian Shippers Council, Mr Akutah Ukeyima, noted that the rail transport happens to be the best form of transport, cheapest and safest for shippers to move goods and promote trade activities in the country.

“Recall that sometimes last year, the Nigerian Shippers Council and the NRC signed a Memorandum of Understanding to look into the possibility of the rail transport to support trade.

“We understand that the rail transport happens to be the best form of transport, cheapest and safest for shippers to move goods across the country,” he said

Mr. Ukeyima appreciated President Bola Tinubu for the initiative aimed at supporting all agencies of government to work together seamlessly with the private sector to develop critical infrastructure in the country.",2025-02-11T12:12:26+00:00,https://radionigerialagos.gov.ng/nrc-apm-terminals-relaunch-lagos-ibadan-cargo-train-service/,382d6c70e1c94a838a9f5536d55339b3

"The sandwich chain has written to subscribers to tell them its Club Pret monthly subscription fee will remain at £5, saying: “At Pret, we believe in offering high-quality, organic coffee and Barista-made drinks at fantastic value.

“With Club Pret, you’ll continue to enjoy great savings on up to five Barista-made drinks per day.”

Pret had previously told subscribers that their subscription would increase to £10 a month from March 31, when a “50% off” deal ended.

It followed Pret overhauling its £360-a-year subscription in July last year in favour of 50% off up to five coffees a day for £10 a month.

The chain also removed a 20% discount on food for subscribers to end dual pricing – “something we never really got comfortable with”, it said at the time.

Under the old deal that lasted for almost four years, Club Pret membership offered up to five barista-made drinks daily for a monthly fee of £30.

In March last year, the chain implemented a crackdown to prevent Club Pret subscribers from sharing free drinks with others.

Some customers were exploiting loopholes by sharing subscription benefits, prompting the changes.

The announcement followed coffee bean prices reaching an all-time high of 4,300 US dollars (£3,356) a tonne last week, amid poor harvests, particularly in the major production areas of Brazil and Vietnam, geopolitical conflict and supply chain disruption.

"11th February, 2025, Gurugram: Policybazaar has launched its latest campaign, Make A Difference, touching upon the crucial role of its advisors in guiding families toward financial security. The campaign celebrates professionals who push past hesitation, unanswered calls and reluctant nods, knowing that the real impact of their work is often understood too late. While no one wakes up excited to buy insurance, the advisors are still committed to making a difference every day.

The brand film opens with a Policybazaar advisor making calls regarding term life insurance, only to be met with dismissal. Even a face-to-face meeting doesn’t turn out to be any better. However, when he gets intimated about a term insurance claim of ₹2 crore of a customer being approved by the insurer, he approaches the family not just with news, but with the reassurance that, even in loss, they have the financial stability to move forward. The policyholder’s wife thanks him for helping her husband make this crucial decision which will now secure their future.

Samir Sethi, head of brand marketing at Policybazaar, says, “Insurance isn’t something that people actively seek, but it’s definitely something they wish they had when a tragedy strikes. Our aim was to capture that quiet resilience of our advisors who hold the consumer’s hand through this decision, their patience to have the hard conversations and the conviction to break through the indifference. But most importantly, it captures their extraordinary dedication to stand by the insured’s family when it matters the most – during claims.”

The ad closes with the advisor feeling a sense of purpose and renewed determination to keep going, knowing that his work truly matters when it’s needed most.

Dheeraj Renganath, co-founder & CCO, MagicCircle Communications, said, “As Policybazaar’s creative partner, we recognize and value their commitment to insuring every Indian family against death, disease and disability. But the harsh truth about insurance, especially life and health insurance, is that it something everyone should have, but hopefully never ever need. This is why it is such a difficult task to convince consumers to take it. And at the core of this endeavour, are the unsung heroes of Policybazaar – their agents. Through this film, we have showcased the fine balance they strive to maintain through the functional aspect of the job as well as its emotional aspect. Both of which make a real difference to someone’s life.”

Policybazaar has helped insure over 2 crore people* and remains committed to simplifying insurance decisions, helping fast-track claims and offering round-the-clock support. The campaign captures the essence of its customer assistance in challenging times and ‘making a difference’ in their lives.",2025-02-11T12:10:52+00:00,https://newspatrolling.com/make-a-difference-policybazaars-latest-brand-campaign-honours-people-behind-the-policies/,5077018f064949d39e5bba1f149ad806

"Solana’s recent price action has sparked fresh optimism, as major investors—often called “smart whales”—have aggressively increased their holdings.

On-chain data suggests that around $18.5 million worth of SOL was scooped up during a volatile trading session, reinforcing bullish sentiment around the token’s future.

According to blockchain analytics platform Spotonchain, two high-profile wallets made substantial purchases from major exchanges.

One wallet, inactive for nearly a year, suddenly re-emerged to buy over $6.2 million in SOL from Binance, while another, dormant for two months, acquired more than $12.4 million in tokens from Binance and OKX.

These investors, known for their profitable trading history, have fueled speculation that Solana’s price could surge in the near term.

Adding to the optimism, discussions surrounding a potential Solana ETF have gained traction.

"(CNN) — While India has been spared any tariffs from the new Trump administration so far, Trump said recently that reciprocal tariffs will be announced on any countries with tariffs on US goods, which would include India. Meanwhile, India could be mounting a case to avoid such tariffs, as the country has recently reviewed its trade policies in a move believed to entice additional trade with the US, according to several Reuters reports.

US trade policies are under the microscope after President Donald Trump enacted — or has said he’s planning to enact — tariffs on the country’s three largest trading partners and teased more, broader tariffs in the coming days. With Narendra Modi, prime minister of India, expected at the White House later this week, CNN takes a look at the trade relationship between the two countries.

Here is what you need to know about US-India trade:

The US is India’s largest trade partner as of 2024, yet India ranks tenth in the list of US trading partners for the same year. The bilateral trade between the US and the world’s most populous nation stands at $129.2 billion in 2024, a record for the partnership.

With Trump planning to impose 25% tariffs on the US’s two top trade partners, Mexico and Canada, and a 10% tariff already in effect on Chinese goods, experts say India could benefit from these strained trade relationships by exporting more technology, electronics and jewelry to America.

“The United States and India both want to enhance their economic influence in the Indo-Pacific region and blunt China’s economic primacy. The time is ripe and the incentives are in place for these two leaders to beat the odds and make a major deal,” wrote Kenneth I. Juster, former US ambassador to India from 2017 to 2021, and Mark Linscott, former assistant US trade representative for South and Central Asian affairs from 2016 to 2018, in a January 21 Foreign Policy article.

The trade deficit between the US and India has been widening, with the United States importing $45.7 billion more from India than it exported there in 2024. And US imports from India accounted for about 2.7% of all imported goods last year.

Trump as been vocal about Modi’s own penchant for tariffs, but there have been signs that the Southeast Asian country is open to cooling on levies. Earlier this month, India’s finance minister slashed the import duty on motorcycles, a move benefiting American bike company Harley Davidson.

What comes in and what goes out

The US counts pearls, semi-precious stones, pharmaceutical products, and electrical equipment among their top imports from India. In 2023, imports of the top five products going from India to the US totaled more than $47 billion.

Modi is expected to visit Washington on Wednesday and Thursday this week, February 12 through 13.

The two leaders spoke on the phone on January 27, seven days after Trump’s inauguration, where they discussed expanding cooperation, security in the Indo-Pacific and the importance of India buying more US-made security equipment.",2025-02-11T11:46:22+00:00,https://www.news8000.com/lifestyle/money/the-india-us-trade-relationship-in-4-charts/article_937d44a6-edb6-561d-a3cd-bc16dcfc0826.html,acc1284259f64c1a8adf8f9386b8d042
"Square Mile has reintroduced the £978m Jupiter UK Dynamic Equity fund into its Academy of Funds with an ‘A’ rating, after Alex Savvides took charge of the strategy from Ben Whitmore last October.

The fund, previously known as Jupiter UK Special Situations, had its ‘AAA’ rating suspended in early 2024 on the news that Whitmore was leaving the firm to set up his own boutique.

Under Savvides, who joined from JO Hambro, the concentrated strategy aims to invest in undervalued UK large and medium-sized listed companies.

JP Morgan Asset Management’s Multi Asset Income fund has seen its A rating removed by Square Mile on performance concerns, with the fund lagging its peers in the IA Mixed Investment 20-60% Shares sector over three and five years.

Meanwhile, the Premier Miton Multi-Asset Global Growth fund also lost its A rating. Despite the analysts’ conviction in Ian Rees and the wider team at Premier Miton, they have concerns over the fund’s medium-term track record, which they believe has resulted in a “meaningful loss of assets”.

The analysts also stripped the Ninety One UK Sustainable Equity fund of its ‘Responsible A’ rating after unitholders voted in favour of merging the strategy into the Ninety One Global Sustainable Equity fund.

In terms of upgrades, Fidelity Special Values investment trust and its sister fund Fidelity Special Situations have both been upgraded to AA from A by Square Mile.

“This recognises Alex Wright’s consistent and unwavering adherence to his contrarian, multi-cap investment style since taking over as the strategies’ lead manager in 2014 and 2012 respectively,” the analysts said. “Despite challenging market conditions for multi-cap portfolios, Wright has delivered strong performance across both strategies on an absolute and relative basis.”

In a multi-asset heavy update, the BNY Mellon Multi-Asset Balanced fund was bumped up to an AA rating while the Aviva Investors MAF Core range received a ‘Recommended’ rating.

Following the announcement of Foresight Group’s acquisition of WHEB Asset Management, Square Mile has decided to maintain FP WHEB Sustainability Impact’s ‘Responsible AA’ rating.

After speaking to George Latham, managing partner of WHEB, the analysts said their initial view is that the acquisition will not materially affect the management process underlying the fund.

Square Mile has also decided to retain ratings on the Liontrust Special Situations, UK Smaller Companies, and UK Growth funds despite the retirement of portfolio manager Julian Fosh.",2025-02-11T12:21:23+00:00,https://portfolio-adviser.com/square-mile-reintroduces-jupiter-uk-dynamic-equity-fund-into-academy-ratings/,1b4ca76b3533469d905a2b756d797c5c
"After a period at Red Bull Racing, Prodromou rejoined McLaren in 2014 as chief engineer. Since stepping into his current role in March 2023, he has had a transformative impact. Under his leadership, McLaren’s aerodynamics department turned the team’s car from a backmarker into the fastest on the grid.

""I am delighted to continue my role as Technical Director, Aerodynamics at McLaren F1 Team. It is an honour to be part of such a collaborative team and contributing to this strong upwards trajectory. Following last season’s success, I look forward to contributing further to our shared ambition of securing more World Championships."" Prodromou said.

Team boss Andrea Stella is equally pleased with Prodromou's new contract. ""It is my great privilege to confirm the extension of Peter's contract on a multi-year deal. The cultural, organisational and technical leadership Peter has brought has been invaluable, and he has been a key architect of the team's performance turnaround, on and off the track, securing the team's ninth FIA Formula 1 Constructors’ Championship in 2024.""

"Scientists Discover 'Super-Earth' Outside Our Solar System And It Is 20 Light-Years Away

A new super-Earth, HD 20794 d, has been discovered that lies within the habitable zone of the system.

Scientists have officially confirmed the discovery of a new super-Earth, HD 20794 d, located just 20 light-years away. This exoplanet, with a mass six times that of Earth, orbits a sun-like star and lies within the habitable zone—meaning it could potentially support liquid water and, possibly, life.

The planet was initially detected in 2022 by Dr. Michael Cretignier from Oxford University while analysing data from the HARPS (High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher) spectrograph at Chile’s La Silla Observatory. He observed tiny, periodic shifts in the star’s light spectrum, likely caused by the gravitational influence of a nearby planet. However, the weak signal made it difficult to confirm the planet’s existence with certainty at the time.

“The original signal was at the edge of the spectrograph’s detection limit, so it was hard to be completely convinced if it was real or not,"" Dr. Cretignier explained.

To verify the discovery, an international team of scientists analysed data spanning two decades, combining findings from HARPS with observations from a more advanced instrument, ESPRESSO. Their research ultimately confirmed HD 20794 d as a super-Earth, strengthening hopes of finding habitable planets beyond our solar system.

“We worked on data analysis for years, gradually analysing and eliminating all possible sources of contamination,"" added Dr Cretignier.

With advanced data processing methods, they were finally able to prove that the signal belonged to a real planet.

“For me, it was naturally a huge joy when we could confirm the planet’s existence. Excitingly, its proximity to us (only 20 light years) means there is hope for future space missions to obtain an image of it,"" Dr Cretignier said.

HD 20794 d is unique because its orbit is not perfectly circular. Instead, it follows an elliptical path which means it moves from the outer edge of the habitable zone to the inner edge throughout its year.

Even though scientists cannot yet determine if HD 20794 d has the right conditions for life, its proximity to Earth makes it crucial for future space missions. Advanced telescopes such as the Extremely Large Telescope, the Habitable Worlds Observatory and the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE) are expected to study the atmospheres of such planets to search for “biosignatures"" which indicate potential life.

Dr Cretignier is eager to see how other scientists will build upon this discovery. “While my job mainly consists of finding these unknown worlds, I’m now very enthusiastic to hear what other scientists can tell us about this newly discovered planet,"" he said.",2025-02-11T12:15:00+00:00,https://www.news18.com/viral/scientists-discover-super-earth-outside-our-solar-system-and-it-is-20-light-years-away-aa-9223599.html,8b09d9c1fbee4edea4c822a0f9b5c083

"There seems to be little that President Trump and one of his first-term national security advisers, John Bolton, agree on publicly these days — but one issue may be whether the U.S. should acquire Greenland from Denmark.

Making Greenland an American territory or commonwealth, in Bolton's view, could help with security interests of ""critical importance"" to the U.S. and allies in fending off potential threats from adversaries like Russia and China.

Trump fired Bolton, who had previously served as his U.S. ambassador to the U.N., in 2019 — the same year the president first spoke about his ambitions for Greenland. And Bolton told NPR that he thinks the president ruined the country's chances of negotiating to acquire the semiautonomous territory by failing to speak privately with Danish leaders about the possibility first.

While Bolton maintains there are other paths to allowing the U.S. and allies to fend off geopolitical threats in the Arctic region, he accused Trump of acting like a ""playground bully"" in his approach — noting Trump's refusal to rule out military force to take Greenland.

""President Trump's America First Policy is already paying dividends – especially in the Western Hemisphere. Both Mexico & Canada have agreed to send troops and personnel to our borders to stop the flow of fentanyl from China, Panama is ending its Belt & Road deal with China, Maduro has released six American hostages from Venezuela, and Colombia agreed to take repatriation flights for their citizens in the U.S. illegally. We're sorry John Bolton can't comprehend the President's many successes in just three weeks.""

All Things Considered host Juana Summers spoke to Bolton about his views on Trump's policy toward Greenland and Denmark.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Juana Summers: Obviously, a possible acquisition of Greenland is a sensitive topic for many. You've talked in the past about President Trump's plans to negotiate with Denmark to buy Greenland during his first term. And you've said that he effectively blew up any possibility of that happening by airing those plans publicly before privately raising them with Danish leaders. So to achieve the kinds of strategic security goals that exist in the region now, what kind of path forward do you think there is?

John Bolton: Well, I'd be happy if everybody started to just put it behind them and not discuss it publicly. It's obviously sensitive both for the government of Denmark and for the local government in Greenland. And by making outrageous statements, including refusing to rule out the use of force, Trump is getting in his own way. He's making it harder to reach a solution that everybody might agree on, because in a democratic society, when you act like you're a playground bully, you put other democratic leaders in a difficult position — you're driving them into a corner. It's making it much harder for them to think about ways that we can find something that's mutually acceptable. So this was true in 2019. And, you know, we've lost almost six years, and he's come close to doing it again. I think reasonable people can put it back together. But all of this discussion has been a waste of time.

Summers: So Greenland, as you know, would have to, in all likelihood, vote for independence from Denmark first in order to become a U.S. territory. And as you know, Greenland's prime minister has repeatedly said Greenlanders do not want to be Danish and they don't want to be American either. So I'd like to ask you, ambassador, in your diplomatic expertise, how could the U.S. best make the case to Greenlandic citizens and leaders who clearly have strong feelings about their own autonomy, their own independence?

Bolton: Well, there are arrangements, even with U.S. sovereignty, that would give them considerable independence in all local matters. They could become a commonwealth of the United States like Puerto Rico is. And beyond that, there are other things that exist, like the 1951 Defense of Greenland treaty, which is a bilateral treaty between the U.S. and Denmark. We could work on that. And even if Greenland became independent, I certainly hope they would be a NATO member if they decided on that. It's hard to talk about all these publicly with so much at stake, but there are a range of options. And I do think if we could just get back on an even keel here and stop thinking about Trump casinos in the capital of Greenland, it would be a lot easier to get things accomplished.

Summers: You mentioned the casino, so I do want to ask you about that. You've mentioned that Trump wants to potentially put a casino in Greenland's capital. And back in 2019, he posted a tweet that promised not to put up a Trump property there. To your own knowledge, has he said on record that he might want to put a casino in Nuuk?

Bolton: Well, it was just this sort of juvenile thing that put out a picture of a casino there and [say], ""But I'm not going to do it."" I don't think it was well received in Greenland, let's put it that way. And this is a very serious matter. It's another indication on issues that have enormous national security implications. Trump doesn't see the gravity of what he's dealing with and the harm that can be caused by these kinds of playground-level statements.

Summers: Regardless of what we can tell about the president's motivations, a lot of people who are watching him in his first few weeks in office think that the current rhetoric on Greenland, when you take it alongside what he has had to say about Canada or the Panama Canal as well as Gaza, that it signals a shift to a new era of American imperialism and trying to take over other sovereign places. So, I'm curious what you would say to that part of the discourse and whether you think that concerns about security should outweigh concerns about independence and colonialism?

Bolton: Well, I think the U.S. is about the least imperialist major power in human history. I think our record is not entirely clear on that, but it is much different from almost every other great power over the course of recorded history. And I think that to say that Trump has created a new doctrine or he has a new policy is the most inaccurate thing of all, because Trump doesn't have a philosophy, he doesn't have a national security grand strategy, doesn't do policy in the way we conventionally understand that. And so I think all of these things, although he mentioned them, that at one point, all in one statement, do not form a coherent strategy. And in fact, simply the way he presents them makes it more difficult for him and the United States to achieve the objectives that he says he wants. You know, people say, well, that's the way he negotiates in business. And I just ask most businesspeople, do you with respect to your customers and suppliers, do you slap them around publicly, frequently? Does that help your business or hurt it? Trump doesn't seem to get the point there.",2025-02-11T07:00:00+00:00,https://www.southcarolinapublicradio.org/2025-02-11/john-bolton-on-expanding-into-greenland,036f2782748d4d3fa67e440c64a9b3c3

"“The deployers that were used until now in the world were at least three times more than the actual mass of the satellite. That pushes the cost incredibly high. So, now we are working on an absolutely economical manner and bringing down the mass of the deployer at least to 1/10th of what it actually was,” said Kesan.

Through her Mission ShaktiSAT, she has already been leveling the space sector for women and the less privileged. Her fourth satellite mission for instance, Azzadisat, which she launched in 2023 via Indian Space Research Organisation, for which she collaborated with the Indian government, Kesan involved 750 girl students from government schools in rural areas.

Chennai-based Kesan, a B Com graduate, said she had embraced being a housewife until she went for a visit to NASA and came across Nano satellites. ""I had an epiphany: this is it, this is the purpose of my birth, my journey henceforth,"" said Kesan.

""Space Kidz India is now a decade old, we started off by launching high altitude balloons, then sub orbital because, ultimately, we wanted to enter into orbital satellites. We have built 27 space missions, and I am the only woman founder in the world to have had high school and university students build real time satellites with applications, that is, for telecommunication,” said Kesan.

Kesan wants to take this further with her newly developed deployer under the 1U TO 3U category, which is already in space. According to her, it has been validated in the SSLV-D3, along with EOS-08 that was launched on Aug. 16, 2024, by ISRO.",2025-02-11T12:08:10+00:00,https://www.ndtvprofit.com/technology/ka-aeroindia-innovation-r,d228150acc38411f86e7a310c1778640

"DAEJEON -- A teacher accused of stabbing an 8-year-old student to death at an elementary school in the central city of Daejeon has said she was ""annoyed"" at being excluded from a class, police said Tuesday.

The female teacher in her 40s gave the statement to police after admitting she stabbed the girl on the second floor of the school on Monday. The girl was later pronounced dead at a hospital due to excessive bleeding.

""I got annoyed just three days after returning to work,"" she was quoted as telling the police, after accusing another person who was not identified of stopping her from teaching a class.

Police said the suspect was found to have received treatment for depression since 2018 and thought of killing herself while on a six-month sick leave that began in early December.

She returned from her leave early, however, and on the day of the attack, purchased a weapon before returning to the school in search of a target.

The teacher told police she waited for children to file out of an after-school class with the intent of dying together with a child.

""I told the last child leaving that I would give her a book and took her with me to the audiovisual room where I strangled and stabbed her,"" she was quoted as telling police.

The suspect also stabbed herself and is currently recovering at a hospital.

She was found to have shown signs of aggression earlier as well, including last Thursday, when she reportedly twisted the arm of another teacher for asking if anything was wrong.

The two were separated by other faculty members, but no reports were filed with the police at the time.

The Daejeon Metropolitan Police Agency said it has secured court warrants to detain the teacher for questioning, and search her home and vehicle to confiscate cellphone, hospital records and others for evidence.

They also plan to conduct an autopsy on the child's body to help determine the exact cause of death. The bereaved family, who had initially opposed the autopsy, changed their mind and agreed to allow the procedure, police said.",2025-02-11T11:49:03+00:00,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10417676,9081ce56985f4f02a8a69c2c5ea83f74
"One person was killed and others were injured when a private jet owned by Mötley Crüe singer Vince Neil collided with another jet Monday afternoon at the Scottsdale Airport in Arizona, authorities said.

Neil’s jet was landing at the airport when it veered off the runway and collided with another parked plane, Neil’s representative Worrick Robinson, IV, said in a statement. There were two pilots and two passengers on Neil’s plane, but he was not among them.

“Mr. Neil’s thoughts and prayers go out to everyone involved, and he is grateful for the critical aid of all first responders assisting today,” Robinson said.

The arriving jet veered off the runway and collided with the Gulfstream 200 jet that was parked on private property, according to Kelli Kuester, aviation planning and outreach coordinator at the Scottsdale Airport. It appeared that the left main landing gear of the arriving jet failed, resulting in the collision, she said.

Kuester said four people were on the arriving jet, which had come from Austin, Texas, and one person was in the parked plane.

Two people injured in the collision were taken to trauma centers and one was in stable condition at a hospital, Scottsdale Fire Department Capt. Dave Folio said. He said they were working to recover the body of the person killed in the collision.

“Our thoughts and prayers go out to everybody involved in this,” Folio said.

The runway has been closed and will remain closed “for the foreseeable future,” Kuester said.

Scottsdale Mayor Lisa Borowskysaid in a statement that she is closely monitoring the situation and is in touch with the airport, police and federal agencies.

“On behalf of the city of Scottsdale, we offer our deepest condolences to those involved in the accident and for those who have been taken to our trauma center for treatment,” she said. “We will keep all affected by this tragedy in our prayers.”

The airport is a popular hub for jets coming in and out of the Phoenix area, especially during big sports weekends like the Waste Management Phoenix Open golf tournament, which attracts huge crowds just a few miles away.

The Scottsdale collision comes after three major U.S. aviation disasters in the past two weeks.

A commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter collided near the nation’s capital on Jan. 29, killing 67 people. A medical transportation plane crashed in Philadelphia on Jan. 31, killing the six people on board and another person on the ground. And last week a small commuter plane crashed in western Alaska on its way to the hub community of Nome, killing all 10 people on board.",2025-02-11T12:20:03.995000+00:00,https://www.masslive.com/news/2025/02/1-dead-after-private-jets-collide-at-scottsdale-airport-in-arizona.html,e3bc24425d8440a291b618420b1da667

"The Western North media space has been shaken by the devastating news of the passing of celebrated journalist Isaac Kwadwo Owusu, fondly known as Natty Bongo. The beloved broadcaster, who was a pillar at Liberty 92.7 FM in Sefwi Wiawso and also contributed significantly to Peace 104.3 FM, took his final bow on February 9, 2025, after battling an illness with resilience.

 

 

 

 At just 43, his untimely demise has left a deep wound in the hearts of his family, colleagues, and the entire media fraternity. Born on April 9, 1982, Natty Bongo leaves behind three children—a daughter and two sons—who now carry the torch of his legacy. His influence within the Western North Journalists Association remains undeniable, with members struggling to come to terms with the heartbreaking loss.

 

 

 

 Liberty FM staff have poured out tributes, remembering him as a dedicated journalist who lived and breathed the profession. “Natty wasn’t just a colleague; he was family. His passion, energy, and commitment to the truth made him a force in journalism,” a close associate remarked. Social media has since been flooded with messages of condolence, as journalists and fans alike honor the man who gave so much to the media world.

 

 



 Beyond the headlines and radio waves, Natty Bongo was a mentor and a friend to many. His influence stretched beyond the newsroom, leaving an indelible mark on the communities he served. As tributes continue to flow, one thing remains clear—his legacy will never fade.

 

 As we say goodbye to this remarkable journalist, we also celebrate the life he lived and the inspiration he leaves behind. Rest well, Natty Bongo—your voice may be silent, but your impact will echo for generations.Source:https://www.facebook.com/61561063455053/posts/pfbid0FxkH4CH7mBozeDKfWiKp2gAKyGRhm9MXgZySvvpMm8TuSjQbzDn5MDpvTJAum2GCl/?",2025-02-11T11:35:01+00:00,https://www.ghanaweb.com/blogs/spencerwan/Natty-Bongo-Passes-On-Media-Mourns-The-Death-Of-A-Legend-8959,57d0bad2063247eb9899a9d27b2e0983

"Global multi-currency accounts platform, Raenest, has secured $11 million Series A investment as it plans to expand its cross-border money management for Africans.

The round was led by QED Investors, with participation from Norrsken22, alongside follow-on investment from Ventures Platform, P1 Ventures, and Seedstars. This equity-based capital injection brings Raenest’s total venture funding to $14.3 million.

The company will aim to deepen its operations in Nigeria, while also strengthening its Kenyan presence. The company also plans to enter the United States and Egypt this year, broadening its impact with Africans within the continent and outside the continent, and also attract top talent to support its growth.

According to a statement shared with Business Post, Raenest is set to expand its reach and strengthen its role in the growing cross-border payments industry, which is projected to reach $320 trillion by 2032.

“Africa remains one of the fastest-growing regions for global transactions. With the backing of global and early-stage investors, Raenest is well-positioned to deliver fast, transparent, and affordable financial tools that simplify cross-border money management.

“By scaling its infrastructure, deepening partnerships with global financial institutions and enhancing its multi-currency offerings, Raenest is enabling more African businesses and individuals to participate fully in the global economy,” the statement added.

Raenest holds licenses in Nigeria as an approved International Money Transfer Operator (IMTO) and in Canada as a Money Services Business (MSB) and is working to secure additional licenses in key jurisdictions.

The company will be banking on its strategic partnerships with leading banks in the US and UK, to ensure operational stability and reliability, and plans to use the funding to form additional collaborations with financial institutions worldwide.

The startup which was founded in 2022 by Mr Victor Alade, Mr Sodruldeen Mustapha, and Mr Richard Oyome, initially operated as an Employer of Record (EOR) before evolving into a platform that redefines global banking for Africans, helping businesses and freelancers receive international payments, convert between currencies, operate a multi-currency wallet, while managing transactions seamlessly.

The company claims it amassed over 700,000 individual customers, processed over $1 billion in payments, and currently serves over 300 businesses, including MoniePoint, Helium Health, Fez Delivery, and Matta.

Also, Raenest offers a consumer-focused product, Geegpay, which provides Africa’s gig economy, particularly freelancers, creators, remote workers, and solopreneurs, with efficient solutions for receiving payments from Upwork, Fiverr, Gusto, as well as other overseas platforms and clients while minimising fees.

Speaking on the announcement, Mr Alade, CEO of Raenest, said: “At Raenest, we are dedicated to addressing the barriers that hinder Africans from accessing seamless financial services. Our journey over the past two years has been shaped by innovation, collaboration, and a shared vision to build a sustainable, globally impactful business that bridges economic and digital divides.

“This funding, supported by new and existing investors who share our mission, provides the momentum to scale our solutions and expand our impact across the continent. We are excited to continue building solutions that connect Africa to the world and drive inclusive growth and prosperity.”

On his part, Mr Gbenga Ajayi, Partner and Head of Africa and the Middle East at QED Investors, added: “At QED, we’re thrilled to support Raenest as they redefine cross-border banking for Africans. Their commitment to financial inclusion, combined with a seamless user experience, positions Raenest as a game-changer in the region’s fintech landscape.

“We firmly believe that by bridging the gap between local and global markets, Raenest will unlock new opportunities for African entrepreneurs, freelancers and businesses, ultimately driving greater economic empowerment across the continent.”

Adding her bit, Ms Lexi Novitske, General Partner of Norrsken22, “Africa’s gig economy is growing at an impressive 20 per cent year-on-year, yet cross-border payment challenges persist for workers and businesses alike.

“Our investment in Raenest reflects our belief that they are unlocking new opportunities by transforming how Africa’s global workforce connects to the world economy.”

For Mr Kola Aina, Founder and General Partner at Ventures Platform, he emphasised their continued support saying, “As one of Raenest’s earliest backers, we have witnessed their exceptional growth, their consistent delivery of quality and reliable services to customers, and their ability to deliver meaningful impact in the financial services sector. Raenest’s unwavering commitment to Africa’s gig economy and businesses is evident at every stage of their journey, and we are thrilled to see them continue to scale while staying true to their bold vision.”",2025-02-11T12:12:54+00:00,https://businesspost.ng/economy/raenest-receives-11m-to-boost-cross-border-transactions/,8de9c85047554dee8a2818d87b010985
"McLaren have today announced a multi-year contract extension for Peter Prodromou, the team’s F1 technical director in the aerodynamics department.

Prodromou was announced in his current role in March 2023 and has played a key role in the team’s rapid ascent to becoming constructors’ world champions last year for the first time since 1998.

McLaren’s aerodynamic efficiency, in particular their at times controversial rear-wing flexibility, has been a vital cog in Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri experiencing success on the track.

Prodromou enjoyed a period of success at Red Bull from 2010-2013 before returning to McLaren – where he started his F1 journey in 1991 – in 2014 as chief engineer.

""I am delighted to continue my role as Technical Director, Aerodynamics at McLaren F1 Team,” Prodromou said.

“It is an honour to be part of such a collaborative team and contributing to this strong upwards trajectory. Following last season’s success, I look forward to contributing further to our shared ambition of securing more World Championships.

""I’m grateful to Zak and Andrea for their continued confidence in me as a Technical Director, Aerodynamics and also to all my colleagues in the team who have provided the highest class of support to me at a personal and professional level.""

The news follows recent multi-year contract extensions for Norris, Piastri and team principal Andrea Stella.

""It is my great privilege to confirm the extension of Peter's contract on a multi-year deal,” Stella said.

“The cultural, organisational and technical leadership Peter has brought has been invaluable, and he has been a key architect of the team's performance turnaround, on and off the track, securing the team's ninth FIA Formula 1 Constructors’ Championship in 2024.

""The journey we have been on together as a team, we could not have done without Peter, and we look forward to continuing our quest of fighting for further World Championships together.

“Thank you, Peter, for your commitment and dedication to the McLaren F1 Team, we are all proud to call you our teammate.""

"Over thirty students from Sawla Senior High School (SHS) in the Sawla-Tuna-Kalba District of the Savannah Region have been suspended indefinitely.

 

 The majority of those suspended are girls, and they are accused of bringing mobile phones to school, in violation of the Ghana Education Service (GES) rules and regulations.

 

 Sources within the Sawla-Tuna-Kalba District Directorate of GES indicate that the suspended students are also involved in various immoral activities while at school.

 

 A seven-member committee, constituted by the school management to investigate the matter, found all the students guilty of the allegations, leading to their suspension.

 

 In recent years, Sawla Senior High School has made headlines due to issues such as inappropriate tutor-student relationships. Some individuals accused of misconduct were dismissed, while others were suspended.

 

 However, information reaching suggests that some parents, who claim they were not officially notified of the suspensions, are protesting the actions taken by the school.

 

 One parent expressed frustration, saying, “If I entrusted my child into your care, why should I be asked to send her packing without receiving official notice about the students involved? What kind of management is this?”

 

 Another parent, Ferida Issahaku, voiced her displeasure with the school’s decision to act unilaterally, without involving the parents. “I only heard about the suspension from a friend. I should have been informed, and perhaps even gone to collect her. As of now, she hasn’t returned, and we don’t know her whereabouts,” said Madam Ferida Issahaku.

"Adiembra New Town (WN/R), Feb.11, GNA – Mr Wilberforce Petty Brentum, the Western North Regional minister, has assumed office with a call on stakeholders, including Traditional authorities, Regional Co-ordinating staff and the general public for comprehensive collaboration to ensure accelerated development in the Region.

Mr Brentum lauded the assurance from the acting coordinating director to support him in his duties and asked staff of the Council to be professional in the discharge of their duties so as to implement the President’s agenda for the region.

“I am happy for the reception and the assurance that the coordinating director has given to help me achieve my vision for the region”.

The regional minister who said this in his maiden address to staff and management of the Western North Regional Co-ordinating Council cautioned against sabotaging government business.

Mr Brentum promised to form a team to tour the region to profile all mining activities in the region in order to roll out pragmatic steps to fight illegal mining and logging in the region.

He promised to work closely with the appropriate state institutions to identify challenges and how best to control and manage them.

Mr Bentum, however, expressed worry about the decline in cocoa production in the area and gave the assurance that the necessary measures would be put in place to curb the situation.

He advised cocoa farmers to venture into other businesses to supplement their income since cocoa farming was dwindling.

The regional minister commended chiefs in the region for their support during his vetting and appealed to them to continue to support him to bring the needed development to the region.

He was accompanied to his office by the regional executives of the NDC led by Mr Michael Aidoo, Regional chairman, some constituency executives and other party faithfuls.",2025-02-11T12:00:01+00:00,https://gna.org.gh/2025/02/western-north-regional-minister-takes-office-calls-for-collaboration/,db3b4810739e42d28c574b8f2f9b7832
"President Cyril Ramaphosa (R) says South Africa will not be 'intimidated' by Donald Trump (Ting Shen) (Ting Shen/AFP/AFP)

On the streets of Johannesburg's student district, US President Donald Trump's offer to accept white Afrikaners as refugees landed as both ""ridiculous"" and ""lame"", among South Africans of all races.

On Friday, Trump cut off aid to South Africa and claimed, without evidence, that the Pretoria government is seizing white-owned land and persecuting Afrikaners, descendants of European settlers.

South African-born billionaire Elon Musk, the world's richest person and Trump's right-hand man, has in the past echoed far-right conspiracy theories about a ""white genocide"" in the country.

""Trump doesn't know anything about this. I feel like Elon Musk is pushing him behind and saying: 'There's something there. Go look at it,'"" said Lulusuku Mahlangu.

""Its greed,"" the electrical engineering student said.

""When you have too much power, you think you can control everyone.""

Many have expressed indignation and bemusement that whites could be assigned victim status in South Africa.

The white-supremacist apartheid government, headed by an Afrikaner nationalist party, ruled the country until 1994.

Whites still own two-thirds of farmland and on average earn three times as much as black South Africans.

""I find it funny because I live here and I don't see that sort of persecution in any way,"" said Lwandle Yende, 34.

""It's ridiculous, funny and weird,"" said Yende, a telecommunications specialist with neat black and brown dreadlocks and a chin-curtain beard.

""I think we've been quite accommodating with everything that has happened in our past,"" said Yende, adding: ""There is no such thing like apartheid 2.0.""

Trump's criticism centres on a new law that allows the South African government, in certain particular circumstances, to seize property without payment if this is ruled to be in the public interest.

The law mainly clarifies an existing legal framework. Legal experts have stressed it does not give new powers to the government.

Trump's offer to accept Afrikaners as refugees caught many off guard, including right-wing white lobby groups.

The suggestion ""has some racist undertones,"" said Reabetswe Mosue, 22.

""It is uninformed and borderline lame.""

Trump's executive order pulls the plug on all US funding to South Africa, including a major contribution to the country's HIV programme.

""America has betrayed us by bringing him back,"" 56-year-old pastor Israel Ntshangase said of Trump.

""He messed up with Africa and he is doing it again,"" he said, warning that Trump's policies ""will haunt him"".

The South Africa government has sought to allay fears about the fallout from Trump's resettlement proposal, saying it was ""ironic"" that it came from a nation embarking on a deportation programme.

""Who wants to leave this beautiful country?"" posed Yende as he adjusted his designer shades, adding that his white friends found the proposal laughable.

Trump's scheme appears to offer much to Afrikaners but may ultimately deliver little, said Matthew Butler, a 62-year-old tax and insurance specialist.

""America is not cheap,"" the white man with a calm demeanour told AFP. ""Are you going to have work? How are you going to make a living?""

Nonetheless, the South African Chamber of Commerce in the United States reported a surge in inquiries about resettlement, estimating that 50,000 people may consider leaving South Africa.

None of them should be stopped from leaving, opined University of the Witwatersrand lecturer Hannah Maja, on her way from shopping for a staff party.

""Let them do whatever they want to do in order for them to get the fresh air that they need and want,"" the 28-year-old said sardonically.

""I think there's something interesting when white people get together and decide to fight. Because at the end of the day, black people still suffer,"" she said.

It was a call that did not resonate with film student Clayton Ndlovu, however.

""We do need those Afrikaans. As much as we don't get along, we actually do need them,"" said the 22-year-old.

""Trump is just trying to scare people.""",2025-02-11T12:07:27+00:00,https://sg.news.yahoo.com/ridiculous-lame-south-africans-mock-120727452.html,681b72b66b1d485abbab58c3b26e19ae
"There seems to be little that President Trump and one of his first-term national security advisers, John Bolton, agree on publicly these days — but one issue may be whether the U.S. should acquire Greenland from Denmark.

Making Greenland an American territory or commonwealth, in Bolton's view, could help with security interests of ""critical importance"" to the U.S. and allies in fending off potential threats from adversaries like Russia and China.

Trump fired Bolton, who had previously served as his U.S. ambassador to the U.N., in 2019 — the same year the president first spoke about his ambitions for Greenland. And Bolton told NPR that he thinks the president ruined the country's chances of negotiating to acquire the semiautonomous territory by failing to speak privately with Danish leaders about the possibility first.

While Bolton maintains there are other paths to allowing the U.S. and allies to fend off geopolitical threats in the Arctic region, he accused Trump of acting like a ""playground bully"" in his approach — noting Trump's refusal to rule out military force to take Greenland.

""President Trump's America First Policy is already paying dividends – especially in the Western Hemisphere. Both Mexico & Canada have agreed to send troops and personnel to our borders to stop the flow of fentanyl from China, Panama is ending its Belt & Road deal with China, Maduro has released six American hostages from Venezuela, and Colombia agreed to take repatriation flights for their citizens in the U.S. illegally. We're sorry John Bolton can't comprehend the President's many successes in just three weeks.""

All Things Considered host Juana Summers spoke to Bolton about his views on Trump's policy toward Greenland and Denmark.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Juana Summers: Obviously, a possible acquisition of Greenland is a sensitive topic for many. You've talked in the past about President Trump's plans to negotiate with Denmark to buy Greenland during his first term. And you've said that he effectively blew up any possibility of that happening by airing those plans publicly before privately raising them with Danish leaders. So to achieve the kinds of strategic security goals that exist in the region now, what kind of path forward do you think there is?

John Bolton: Well, I'd be happy if everybody started to just put it behind them and not discuss it publicly. It's obviously sensitive both for the government of Denmark and for the local government in Greenland. And by making outrageous statements, including refusing to rule out the use of force, Trump is getting in his own way. He's making it harder to reach a solution that everybody might agree on, because in a democratic society, when you act like you're a playground bully, you put other democratic leaders in a difficult position — you're driving them into a corner. It's making it much harder for them to think about ways that we can find something that's mutually acceptable. So this was true in 2019. And, you know, we've lost almost six years, and he's come close to doing it again. I think reasonable people can put it back together. But all of this discussion has been a waste of time.

Summers: So Greenland, as you know, would have to, in all likelihood, vote for independence from Denmark first in order to become a U.S. territory. And as you know, Greenland's prime minister has repeatedly said Greenlanders do not want to be Danish and they don't want to be American either. So I'd like to ask you, ambassador, in your diplomatic expertise, how could the U.S. best make the case to Greenlandic citizens and leaders who clearly have strong feelings about their own autonomy, their own independence?

Bolton: Well, there are arrangements, even with U.S. sovereignty, that would give them considerable independence in all local matters. They could become a commonwealth of the United States like Puerto Rico is. And beyond that, there are other things that exist, like the 1951 Defense of Greenland treaty, which is a bilateral treaty between the U.S. and Denmark. We could work on that. And even if Greenland became independent, I certainly hope they would be a NATO member if they decided on that. It's hard to talk about all these publicly with so much at stake, but there are a range of options. And I do think if we could just get back on an even keel here and stop thinking about Trump casinos in the capital of Greenland, it would be a lot easier to get things accomplished.

Summers: You mentioned the casino, so I do want to ask you about that. You've mentioned that Trump wants to potentially put a casino in Greenland's capital. And back in 2019, he posted a tweet that promised not to put up a Trump property there. To your own knowledge, has he said on record that he might want to put a casino in Nuuk?

Bolton: Well, it was just this sort of juvenile thing that put out a picture of a casino there and [say], ""But I'm not going to do it."" I don't think it was well received in Greenland, let's put it that way. And this is a very serious matter. It's another indication on issues that have enormous national security implications. Trump doesn't see the gravity of what he's dealing with and the harm that can be caused by these kinds of playground-level statements.

Summers: Regardless of what we can tell about the president's motivations, a lot of people who are watching him in his first few weeks in office think that the current rhetoric on Greenland, when you take it alongside what he has had to say about Canada or the Panama Canal as well as Gaza, that it signals a shift to a new era of American imperialism and trying to take over other sovereign places. So, I'm curious what you would say to that part of the discourse and whether you think that concerns about security should outweigh concerns about independence and colonialism?

Bolton: Well, I think the U.S. is about the least imperialist major power in human history. I think our record is not entirely clear on that, but it is much different from almost every other great power over the course of recorded history. And I think that to say that Trump has created a new doctrine or he has a new policy is the most inaccurate thing of all, because Trump doesn't have a philosophy, he doesn't have a national security grand strategy, doesn't do policy in the way we conventionally understand that. And so I think all of these things, although he mentioned them, that at one point, all in one statement, do not form a coherent strategy. And in fact, simply the way he presents them makes it more difficult for him and the United States to achieve the objectives that he says he wants. You know, people say, well, that's the way he negotiates in business. And I just ask most businesspeople, do you with respect to your customers and suppliers, do you slap them around publicly, frequently? Does that help your business or hurt it? Trump doesn't seem to get the point there.",2025-02-11T07:00:00+00:00,https://www.ktep.org/world-news/2025-02-11/john-bolton-on-expanding-into-greenland,9d6ed55c9f894d5faf5dce44fe803255

"HOUSTON (KTRK) - A Houston dentist was arrested with more than 100 canisters of laughing gas in his car.

It is used in his line of work but Harris County Sheriff's deputies say he was huffing the gas while driving. And this isn't the first time this dentist has been arrested for this.

Court records show that Christopher Pedlar has been arrested three times since October 2024 for possession of nitrous oxide, a regulated gas commonly known as laughing gas. In two of those instances, he reportedly had over 100 canisters in his possession.

The 39-year-old spent Sunday night in custody after being stopped in The Heights.

Harris County Precinct 1 Constable Alan Rosen stated that Pedlar was clocked speeding on West 19th Street on Sunday afternoon and initially refused to pull over. When he finally stopped half a mile later, the deputy discovered 107 canisters of nitrous oxide in the back seat of his vehicle. One canister was reportedly ice-cold and attached to a mask, suggesting recent use.

""When they questioned him, he admitted to inhaling the gas,"" a hearing officer stated. ""The defendant told the officer he has a problem and had been using it all day.""

This marks the third time in four months that Pedlar has been arrested on similar charges.

Last October, Katy police arrested him for possession, and the next month, Houston police said they found him in his car with 112 gas canisters. Eyewitness News found his first recorded offense involving nitrous oxide in 2017. The Texas State Board of Dental Examiners (TSBDE) issued a warning in 2020 and ordered that Pedlar be evaluated.

The public defender told the court that Pedlar does not actively practice dentistry, but he teaches it. He was a full-time professor at UTHealth School of Dentistry-Houston. By Monday evening, his profile had been removed from the university's website. The school has not issued a statement regarding his employment status.

His defense attorney, David Smith, emphasized that Pedlar's case should be ""tried in a court of law and not in the media.""

Meanwhile, Constable Rosen confirmed that authorities are investigating the source of the nitrous oxide.

""Something could have happened. Thankfully, it didn't,"" Rosen said.

According to KTRK, Pedlar, who has been licensed in Texas since 2012, faces multiple misdemeanor charges, including two counts of possession of a volatile chemical, fleeing a police officer, interfering with a public servant, and possession of inhalant paraphernalia.

He is currently out of jail on bonds totaling $10,000. According to the TSBDE's website, his dental license remains active.",2025-02-11T12:20:03+00:00,https://foxsanantonio.com/newsletter-daily/dentist-arrested-again-with-over-100-laughing-gas-canisters-caught-huffing-while-driving-houston-texas-investigation-harris-county-sheriff-deputy-court-judge-bail,b33e258c638646af978fc42cd39f6952

"Basel: Novartis today announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire Anthos Therapeutics, Inc., a Boston-based, privately held, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with abelacimab, a late-stage medicine in development for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation.

Anthos Therapeutics, launched by Blackstone Life Sciences and Novartis in 2019, has advanced abelacimab through clinical development under a license from Novartis. Abelacimab is a novel, highly selective, fully human monoclonal antibody designed to induce effective hemostasis-sparing anticoagulation through Factor XI inhibition. Phase 2 data showed a significant reduction in bleeding events in patients taking abelacimab versus a standard of care direct-oral anticoagulant in patients with atrial fibrillation (AZALEA1,2). Three Phase 3 clinical trials are ongoing for patients at risk of arterial and venous clots, one in patients with atrial fibrillation (LILAC-TIMI 763) and two in cancer associated thrombosis (ASTER4) and (MAGNOLIA5).

“We are excited to join forces to advance the development of abelacimab, a potential first-in-class treatment and safer approach for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation as well as cancer-associated thrombosis,” said Shreeram Aradhye, M.D., President, Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “Welcoming Anthos Therapeutics strengthens our focus in the cardiovascular space and complements our portfolio of life-changing treatments, comprehensive clinical programs, and strategic collaborations that help thousands of patients with heart disease around the world.”

In July 2022 abelacimab received a Fast Track Designation from the FDA for the treatment of thrombosis associated with cancer. In September 2022 abelacimab was also granted a Fast Track Designation for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation.

“Abelacimab is a potential first-in-class medicine, which promises to be an effective and safer approach to preventing thrombosis and stroke than the current standards of care.” said David Soergel, M.D., Global Head, Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolism Development Unit, Novartis. “We are proud that this medicine originated at Novartis and have been impressed with the Anthos Therapeutics team’s expertise and dedication and with the great progress they have made on the program. Now is the right time to bring abelacimab back into the Novartis CRM pipeline.”

Under the terms of the agreement, Novartis will make an upfront payment of USD 925 million upon closing of the transaction, subject to certain customary adjustments, and potential additional payments of up to USD 2.15 billion upon achievement of specified regulatory and sales milestones. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.",2025-02-11T12:20:38+00:00,https://medicaldialogues.in/news/industry/pharma/novartis-to-acquire-anthos-therapeutics-for-usd-925-million-upfront-bolsters-late-stage-cardiovascular-pipeline-143082,b11b5e5b4b104d249e01b84ee4cf87ac

"In the 15th minute of the contest at Espanyol’s Ciutat Esportiva Dani Jarque ground, Leon appeared to touch the front of fellow defender Caracas’ shorts with her hand as the pair marked each other, then said something to her.

Espanyol released a statement saying what had happened was “unacceptable”, that it had led to Colombia international Caracas receiving abuse on social media, and that they hoped “these types of situations are treated with the seriousness they deserve.”

Centre-back Leon, who played for Spain at the 2019 World Cup as well as the 2017 and 2022 European Championships, subsequently issued a statement of her own via Barcelona, saying: “At no time did I, nor was it my intention (to), infringe upon the intimacy of my fellow professional Daniela Caracas.

“As the images show, it was part of a playing action in which she deliberately touches me and I touch her leg saying in reaction to the clash: ‘What’s up with you?’ There is NO contact with her private parts, and certainly no intention.

“I insist, it was just part of the game that does not warrant the importance that has been attached to it. The idea of touching the private parts of a colleague would never enter my head, it goes against my principles and I would never do such a thing.”

Leon also condemned any harassment Caracas was receiving online, regarding which she offered her “most sincere support.”

And she added: “There has been noise and controversy surrounding my name, aimed solely at damaging my image and principles…I am deeply upset and disappointed, and hence reserve the right to take legal action against whomsoever might be seeking to exploit this strictly footballing incident to cause me damage and continue spreading unfounded accusations.”

Espanyol’s statement said: “We wish to express our complete discontent with, and condemnation of, the events that took place last Sunday…In this game, there was an action that we consider unacceptable and that should not be overlooked.

“During the match, FC Barcelona player Maria Pilar Leon, whilst jostling with Daniela Caracas, made a gesture with her hand that violated the privacy of our player.

“Although Caracas was unable to react at the time due to the impact of the situation, later, after assimilating what had happened, she became aware of the seriousness of the gesture, but chose not to react angrily in order to avoid a disciplinary sanction that would harm the team.

“In addition to what happened on the pitch, there was a regrettable response on social media, where our player was been the target of insults from hundreds of profiles.

“We defend our player and condemn any act that threatens the integrity of footballers on the field. We firmly believe in respect and sportsmanship as fundamental values ​​of football, and we hope that these types of situations are treated with the seriousness they deserve. In addition, we have made the club’s legal services available to our player in the event that she wish to take legal action.”

The PA news agency has approached Liga F for a response.",2025-02-11T12:13:11+00:00,https://www.northwaleschronicle.co.uk/sport/national/24926367.barcelonas-mapi-leon-denies-touching-private-parts-espanyol-player/,a9d8cc5ec3854b99ad694b6387e38eb8
"Today we are celebrating remarkable women, nominated by the BirdLife Partnership in recognition of their leadership, dedication and passion for conserving nature. The path they have chosen has been challenging, often working in male-dominated environments and cultures. Yet, the empowerment of women and girls in science is vital to combat the biodiversity and climate crisis. As described by UN Women, the climate crisis is not ‘gender neutral’: women are and will be disproportionately impacted if we don’t stop the escalation of the crises. The reality is that science needs women, as much as women need science. We need a diversity of voices, experiences and backgrounds to create the innovative, sustainable solutions that will ensure a world where all life can thrive. These are stories of women across the BirdLife Partnership who have led the way to ensure that female voices and perspectives are firmly entrenched in the conservation of nature. Batrisyia Teepol, Member/Researcher, Malaysian Nature Society

“Conservation may not be widely practised in Malaysia, but growing up, I developed a deep love for wildlife and nature. It felt natural for me to want to work in the conservation of nature. Living on Borneo Island, a developing country rich in biodiversity, I cultivated a strong sense of responsibility for protecting wildlife and natural habitats. While conservation is often seen as a male-dominated field globally, it’s inspiring to see that in Southeast Asia, powerful women are leading the way in shorebird conservation. I’m fortunate to be surrounded by supportive and empowering individuals – both men and women, who have never made me doubt my place in the field. I’m content with the progress I’ve made in my career and grateful that I’m able to pursue my passion for migratory shorebirds. If there is one thing I would emphasize, it’s this: listen. We need to make sure everyone is heard and that women are seen as equals, as we all are working toward the same cause – for a better world!” We need to make sure everyone is heard and that women are seen as equals, as we all are working toward the same cause – for a better world! – Batrisyia Teepol Batrisyia Teepol is a Researcher for our Partner the Malaysian Nature Society.

Alena Kacal is the Director of Tourism and Outreach for our Partner BirdLife Israel. Women are often not heard or overlooked – and are often as underrepresented as speakers at conferences, or as professional bird guides. – Alena Kacal “I am the Director of Tourism and Outreach of BirdLife Israel and past Director of the Nili and David Jerusalem Bird Observatory, Israel’s first urban nature site and part of the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel. My passion is leading efforts to create a gender-inclusive birdwatching community. Today, I work on a country-wide level to offer courses, trips, workshops and webinars to people of all ages – in Hebrew and English. For my master’s degree, I conducted a survey of birdwatchers in Israel where I identified a very significant gender gap. This led me to organize Israel’s first women’s only birdwatching conference in March 2019, where 65 female birders from around the country participated and presented. This was followed by additional conferences in 2022 and 2024. In 2020, I formed Women in Steppe – the first international all-women’s team to participate in the Champions of the Flyway bird race in Israel. My hope is to inspire a new generation of female birders to break the glass ceiling. Working as a woman in science and in the birding community has not been easy. It is often a very male-dominated world – especially out in the field. I was encouraged by one professor to learn GIS and stay in the lab, to leave the survey work to the guys. Women are often not heard or overlooked – and are often as underrepresented as speakers at conferences, or as professional bird guides. My advice to all girls who are looking at a career in science is – just do it! Follow your passion and don’t give up. Look for strong women in your field and ask them to mentor you. But I would also say to all of us women working in the field – we need to be always reaching down to help these young women up and to be the strong mentors that they need.”

“I am the Preventing Extinctions Programme Coordinator for Africa based in Nairobi. My work revolves around threatened species, implementing actions to help save them – my focus right now is on African vultures. With 7 out the 11 vultures found in Africa classified as endangered/vulnerable, the work that I do is important in saving these important scavengers. I grew up as a curious child asking hundreds of questions, I have always had a desire to know more about different things. That is what really got me motivated. In terms of working with birds, I spent a year interning for an organisation that was based in Zimbabwe’s largest National Park. This opened my eyes to whole big world of conservation and the rest is history! Working in science, conservation particularly has been exciting. The places I have been, the networks I have made would not have happened without this career. Most people do make the point of how hard it can be for a woman to be in science, it has not been like that for me. I have enjoyed working with a lot of great women that excel at they do in their different fields. My advice is pursuing what you enjoy the most. If you are not sure what to pursue talk to people in that field and ask them about their journey and the opportunities within that field. If you are able to intern, use it to try different things in order to find that which you are good at. Be curious about things, ask questions!” Fadzai Matsvimbo is our Preventing Extinctions Programme Coordinator for Africa. My advice is pursuing what you enjoy the most. If you are not sure what to pursue talk to people in that field and ask them about their journey and the opportunities within that field. – Fadzai Matsvimbo

It is uncommon for conservation to be seen as a career for women in Indonesia; conservation is still seen as a male world, and limited to natural science. – Vincentia Widyasari “Since childhood, I’ve been always questioning things; ‘why’ is my favourite word and I was persistent to get the answers. I grew up with books, nature magazines, and photos of my Dad’s trips (he was a journalist). Following my curiosity and concerns (e.g. why do humans destroy nature?), here I am now, without even realising that I have already dived deep into conservation work. It is uncommon for conservation to be seen as a career for women in Indonesia; conservation is still seen as a male world, and limited to natural science. I have always been confident of my gender and sexuality, but not with my scientific background. I know that I’m good at what I do and excel at it, yet because I’m not from a natural science background, and I don’t have a Master’s degree I have struggled to believe in myself. I am not there yet, however, I have researched, learnt from others and practised in the field to become better. Colleagues’ support has been fantastic; it has helped a lot when doubt has crept in. One of my proudest moments was leading the integration of behaviour change science. Now, behaviour change has become one of the key references in our conservation work. Here is what I think needs to be done to make conservation a safer and more accessible career option for women in Indonesia: 1) Show examples of women working in conservation; share their stories of success, failures, flaws, and overcoming challenges; 2) Invite young girls to join us working in the field, or just simply sit with them and exchange stories; 3) Provide opportunities for courses, studies, and mentorship; 4) Create safe network/supports (informal may be better) of sisterhoods in conservation; 5) Provide the time and energy to mentor young girls.”",2025-02-11T12:15:54+00:00,https://www.birdlife.org/news/2025/02/11/celebrating-the-remarkable-women-within-the-birdlife-partnership-part-1/,bb725012465f4ea995b20b02f74d0654
"In more and more countries, investors can also invest in crypto through traditional stock markets. This is possible via Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), which already exist for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), for example. The United States of course turned the market completely upside down last year, and since then there seem to be more and more dominoes. South Korea could be the following.

The South Korean stock exchange Kosdaq would consider noting crypto ETFs this year. Chairman Jeong Eun-Bo announced this last month during the opening ceremony of the securities market in Seoul.

“We will explore foreign examples for new companies such as cryptocurrency ETFs and new areas in the capital market,” he said.

An ETF is an investment fund that is traded at the stock exchange. A crypto spot ETF immediately follows the price of a specific crypto coin, such as Bitcoin. This means that investors can invest in the value of the crypto coin without having to buy or store it yourself.

With crypto ETFs, Jeong hopes to bring foreign and domestic investors back to the market. Many investors have recently been driven from the stock market by political unrest in the country.

President Yoon Suk-Yeol tried to announce the state of emergency in December because of political tensions, but this failed and caused panic on the stock market. Many investors withdrew their money, so the stock markets fell by an average of 15%. The Korean Won also lost value, and companies saw their shares plummet. Although the measure was withdrawn later, investors’ confidence remained.

The possible introduction of crypto ETFs are part of a broader strategy to modernize the financial sector of the country and to make it more competitive.

The role of crypto ETFs in broad adoption

Although South Korea can of course never match the gigantic capital flows of the Bitcoin and ethereum-ETF’s In the United States, the introduction of crypto-outfs in the country would still be a positive development. Increasing the accessibility of cryptocurrencies, both for private and institutional investors, is crucial for market growth. ETFs play an essential role in this, because they offer a simple and regulated way to invest in crypto without direct exposure to the volatility from the market.

In addition, the approval of a crypto-etf would send a powerful signal to investors in the country. It would show that crypto is recognized as a serious and safe investment option, which can strengthen trust in the market and attract more capital.",2025-02-11T11:49:43+00:00,https://passionategeekz.com/south-korea-may-also-want-to-launch-crypto-etfs-this-year-passionategeekz/,cbb8def724b44d55b6ea5094278aa210

"The Bombay High Court has permitted the Adani group to cut 209 mangroves for the construction of a high voltage transmission line proposed to increase electricity supply in the city and suburbs, noting it was a project of public importance.

The electricity transmission line construction project is critical for Mumbai as the existing capacity of the transmission corridor is not sufficient to carry any further power into the city, a division bench of Chief Justice Alok Aradhe and Justice Bharati Dangre said in its order on February 6.

The HC allowed a petition filed by the Adani Electricity Mumbai Infra Limited, seeking permission to cut 209 mangroves near Vasai creek for setting up a High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) link between two of its transmission substations.

The project involves an 80 kilometre stretch, of which 30 km would be overhead transmission lines and the remaining 50 km would be underground cable in the mangrove area. The HVDC lines would pass through Mumbai, Thane and Palghar districts.

As per the petitioner company, only one kilometre of the HVDC passes through mangrove areas.

The bench in its order said a balance must be struck between the need for sustainable development and requirement to maintain the environment.

""The HVDC project would enable additional power to be supplied to Mumbai and suburbs and shall meet the ever increasing energy demands of the city,"" the court said.

""Considering the public importance of the proposed project, which shall benefit the electricity consumers in the city of Mumbai and its suburbs and which will lead to a potential growth, we deem it appropriate to confer the desired permission,"" the HC said.

As per a 2018 order of the high court, there exists a ""total freeze"" on the destruction of mangroves across the state and permission has to be sought from the HC each time an authority wishes to fell mangroves for any public project.

The court noted that as per the transmission license, Adani was required to commission the project by March 2025, and has received all necessary statutory permissions to cut the mangroves.",2025-02-11T12:23:01+00:00,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-allows-adani-group-to-cut-209-mangroves-for-vital-power-project-101739269706078-amp.html,2852d7220d9843acba385860758c4c92
"Happy Hug Day Video Status Download: Nestled within Valentine's Week, the Hug Day is celebrated on February 12th. The day encourages people to express feelings through a simple yet magical gesture of hug. More than just a physical embrace, a hug is a powerful form of nonverbal communication. We often take hugging our loved ones for granted, but it can convey numerous emotions, from love and comfort to support and reassurance. Hug Day isn't just for couples, it's an apt opportunity to make your family members and friends feel loved and cared for through a platonic hug.

In a world that often feels fast-paced and disconnected, Hug Day provides an opportunity to slow down, reach out, and offer a tangible expression of care to the people in our lives. As the Healthline website quoted, family therapist Virginia Satir, “We need four hugs a day for survival. We need 8 hugs a day for maintenance. We need 12 hugs a day for growth.” However, it's always important to note that being mindful of personal boundaries and ensuring that hugs are always welcome and consensual is important

In an era of hustle and bustle, it sometimes gets difficult to meet your loved ones to give a hug and that’s when the digital world comes into the picture. A lovely Hug Day status video or GIF sent via Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp is just the right way to send a special greeting to your lover, friends or family. A romantic or heartwarming hugging video can be a simple way to brighten someone's day.",2025-02-11T12:21:00+00:00,https://english.jagran.com/trending/happy-hug-day-2025-video-status-download-heartwarming-videos-to-share-on-whatsapp-facebook-and-instagram-10218040,8475efb1760f4c69bb0cb9d91af0980d
"Elon Musk leads a consortium of investors that on Monday submitted a bid of $97.4bn for “all assets” of the nonprofit that controls OpenAI, with Musk escalating his feud with OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman.

Altman posted on X that the bid would not be accepted. OpenAI, which operates ChatGPT, was co-founded as a nonprofit in 2015 by Altman and Musk. It has been working to restructure itself away from its original nonprofit status.

Musk, the world’s richest man, left OpenAI in 2019 and started his own AI company, xAI. He has since tussled with Altman over the direction of the company: he sued OpenAI over the company’s restructuring plans last year, dropped the suit, then refiled it.
• None What did the bidders say? “If Sam Altman and the present OpenAI, Inc. board of directors are intent on becoming a fully for-profit corporation, it is vital that the charity be fairly compensated for what its leadership is taking away from it: control over the most transformative technology of our time,” said Marc Toberoff, the attorney representing the investors.
• None How did Altman respond? Altman posted on X: “no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74bn if you want.” Musk bought Twitter in 2022 for $44bn and renamed it X.

After nearly 10 years of Liberal rule in Canada, a deepening cost of living crisis had soured public support for Justin Trudeau and pollsters predicted the Conservative party, led by Pierre Poilievre, would seize a convincing majority of seat. But since Donald Trump suggested the US might take over Canada – with threats ranging from “economic coercion” to outright annexation – the mood has shifted, and Canada has seen a groundswell of visceral patriotism. One poll, from Ipsos, found that the Conservatives had shed roughly 12 points of support within two weeks, and another found that 40% of Canadians felt Mark Carney – a Liberal and the former governor of the Bank of England – was best suited to face off against Trump, with only 26% saying Poilievre.
• None What are analysts saying now? “Now the election isn’t going to be about Trudeau,” said Éric Grenier, a political analyst at the Writ. “It will most likely be about the next four years – and who is best able to deal with Trump.”

Trump says Gaza ceasefire should be cancelled if all Israeli hostages not freed

Donald Trump has warned that if all the Israeli hostages held in Gaza are not returned by Saturday at noon he would propose canceling the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and let “all hell break loose”.

Speaking to reporters, the president also said he might withhold aid to Jordan and Egypt if those countries do not take Palestinian refugees being relocated from Gaza.

Trump’s comments came after Hamas said it was delaying the release of hostages indefinitely over “violations” of the ceasefire deal, prompting Israel’s defence minister to put the country’s military on alert with orders to prepare for “any scenario in Gaza”.
• None What did the president say? “But as far as I’m concerned, if all of the hostages aren’t returned by Saturday 12 o’clock – I think it’s an appropriate time – I would say cancel it and all bets are off and let hell break out,” Trump said.
• None What does it mean for the ceasefire? Hamas, Israeli and Arab officials have already warned that the ceasefire is at a breaking point, and Trump’s radical intervention could stoke fears that Washington does not have any intent to continue with the phased deal.
• None Israeli police raided the leading Palestinian-owned bookshop in occupied East Jerusalem and detained two owners, in arrests that rights groups and intellectuals condemned for fostering a “culture of fear” among Palestinians.
• None Under orders from Trump, billions of gallons of irrigation water were laid to waste in California’s thirsty agricultural hub this month, a move that left water experts shocked.
• None A bus carrying more than 70 passengers veered off a highway bridge in Guatemala City, killing at least 55 people.
• None The performer in Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl show who was ejected after unfurling a pro-Sudanese and -Palestinian flag will not face legal charges, police said, but he is banned for life from NFL events.
• None A couple in London won a refund on a $40m mansion, after suing the property developer over a moth infestation.

Nearly half a billion dollars of food aid is at risk of spoilage following the decision of Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s “Doge” agency to make cuts to USAid, according to an inspector general report. The decision has already caused chaos and devastation, such as in Malawi, one of the most aid-dependent countries.

"EXCLUSIVE: France’s Mediawan Rights has acquired international sales to Yihwen Chen‘s Berlinale-bound documentary Queer as Punk.

Sales will launch at the EFM as the Locke Films and Talamedia doc about Malaysia’s first openly queer punk band gets its world premiere in the Berlinale Forum Selection on Fenruary 16 at 9pm in Arsenal 1.

Queer as Punk is being billed as a “bold and moving portrayal of Faris, a transgender man, and his punk band as they navigate life and activism in Malaysia, a country where LGBTQ+ rights are criminalized.” Doc blends moments of humor and courage with the raw defiance of punk music to celebrate “a chosen family’s fight for equality and visibility amidst an environment filled with challenges.”

Mediawan Rights has searched out punchy feature docs over recent years, and was the sales agent for the Academy Award-nominated Soundtrack to a Coup d’État last year. Queer as Punk will launch at the EFM on its slate next to Sundance doc GEN_.

“Queer as Punk is a story about resilience, identity, and collective defiance,” said director Chen. “I’m thrilled to partner with Mediawan Rights to bring this important narrative to global audiences and amplify the voices of Malaysia’s first openly queer punk band.”

“Our co-production allowed us to bridge perspectives from Malaysia and Indonesia, amplifying a story that resonates in our countries and also across Southeast Asia and beyond,” added Queer as Punk producer said Mandy Marahimin. “Partnering with Mediawan Rights is an important step in ensuring Queer as Punk reaches audiences globally, fostering dialogue and connection through its powerful narrative.”",2025-02-11T12:19:45+00:00,https://internewscast.com/news/mediawan-rights-acquires-queer-as-punk-documentary-by-yihwen-chen-prior-to-berlinale-debut/,3c739d023aa649e887bb420ddc95dafc
"Solaris Bus & Coach has announced the delivery of the first 37 hydrogen buses of an order for Italian transport operator, TPER.

The delivery of the vehicles, which are due for operation in Bologona and Ferrara, Italy, marks the first phase of a large-scale order placed at the end of 2023.

The order will see Solaris supply TPER with 137 of its Urbino 12 hydrogen buses as part of a strategic partnership between Solaris, city authorities and the operator itself, with funding for the vehicles co-financed by EU funds from the PNRR.

We are honored to contribute to such an ambitious project. The delivery of the first hydrogen buses to Bologna represents a significant milestone in the advancement of sustainable public transport. The Urbino 12 hydrogen buses will help improve air quality, enhancing the well-being of residents in the city and the region.

Solaris’ Urbino 12 hydrogen vehicle features a fully-low floor design and comes equipped with air conditioning systems, monitoring and accessibility capabilities for both strollers and wheelchair users.

"NetBet Italy has partnered with provider Nazionale Elettronica, adding its suite of casino games to the service. The new partnership lets NetBet customers play some of its biggest and best games, including Haunted Kingdom, Lucrezia, Madame Fortuna, Power Ten, Samurai, and more.

NetBet Italty is one of the country’s largest and most prominent gambling companies. It is renowned for its diverse range of casino game libraries in the iGaming sector, which are continually expanding year-on-year.

In contrast, Nazionale Elettronica is based in Faenza, Italy, and focuses on products solely made in the country, primarily as a hardware manufacturer of slot machines and physical games. However, it has since broadened its portfolio to include software-based AWP games and VLT games.

NetBet PR manager Claudia Georgvici said of the partnership: “Adding Nazionale Elettronica as a provider is yet another huge moment in the growth of NetBet Italy and a moment for us as a company to celebrate. This latest partnership deal is also another example of our commitment to offering customers the best possible service – and we feel certain our players will enjoy everything Nazionale Elettronica has to offer.”

Founded in 2008, NetBet Italy has risen to prominence in the country thanks to being one of the first Italian portals built for iGaming, with access to thousands of casino games and daily sports events. Now, it’s adding the lineage of Nazionale Elettronica to its roster. Previously, in November 2023, Blueprint Gaming (based in the UK) partnered with NetBet Italy. This latest partnership shows its commitment to branching out.

More recently, at the end of 2024, NetBet partnered with Flows, an automation platform, to streamline its global operators. This enhanced efficiency and reduced resource constraints, making the new partnerships in geo-specific regions happen faster.

"Writer and East Sussex-based journalist Ali Millar launched herself on the book world in 2022 with The Last Days: A Memoir of Faith, Desire and Freedom, her personal account of life inside the Jehovah’s Witnesses. Released to widespread critical acclaim, it was dubbed a ‘real-life handmaid’s tale’. Her debut novel, Ava Anna Ada, described as ‘a perverse, dark tale of shifting identities, deceit and manipulation’, is out in paperback (White Rabbit, £10.99)

I loved my mother reading to me. I used to demand she read JM Barrie’s Peter Pan every day. Thankfully, it was an abridged version, but I loved Peter, and if I’d been Wendy, I’d have never gone back to London.

The book that inspired me as a teenager

Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger. I know it’s a bit cliched, but I read it at just the right time. I was a moody teenager, living in the countryside, isolated geographically and intellectually, and it seemed to say it was OK to be annoyed with the world, and that there were other worlds out there.

Virginia Woolf’s To the Lighthouse. Sometimes, if I love a book, I don’t finish the last couple of pages, just to keep it alive in my head. I’ve deliberately not finished this because it’s so beautiful that I don’t want it to stop. I also don’t want the sensation of closing the book on the story.

The book that moved me most

It depends how you define moved. Plenty of books have made me cry but Rob Doyle’s Threshold [a celebration of art, ageing, sex and desire] moved me to the point of incandescent rage. I keep writing because I’ve entered some ill-advised competition with it. I think writers don’t talk enough about professional envy. It’s the book I wish I’d written.

"Speaker Mike Johnson intends to begin presenting the outlines of his budget reconciliation package today in the House Republican Conference meeting, even as he’s being squeezed by multiple factions on Capitol Hill.

Johnson believes he’s “very close” to a final budget resolution, which he crafted alongside House Budget Committee Chair Jodey Arrington (R-Texas). Arrington is under a tremendous amount of pressure from the House Republican rank and file, as the budget proposal needed to unlock President Donald Trump’s legislative agenda has been repeatedly delayed.

The House GOP leadership has considered several different budget proposals, ranging from $1 trillion in cuts to up to $2.5 trillion in cuts. They’re desperately in search of a sweet spot that could sate their conservatives and draw support from the conference’s moderates. We reported Monday that Republicans would have to cut Medicaid if they cut upwards of $2 trillion from the budget, which could spook moderates and would be a tough sell with the White House.

But Johnson also has to contend with the Senate. Senate Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) is marking up his own budget resolution proposal on Wednesday and Thursday. Graham’s spending blueprint — blessed by Senate GOP leaders — only includes military, border and energy policy. That pushes the extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts off to another time, which House GOP leaders don’t want to do.

Johnson said Monday evening that the “probability of success on all of the agenda items decreases dramatically” if Republicans follow Graham’s strategy.

One additional wrinkle. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise told us Monday evening that GOP leadership is again considering putting the debt limit in the reconciliation bill. The House Freedom Caucus, which is advocating two bills, is pushing for the debt limit’s inclusion as well. But most aides in the House GOP leadership do not believe it’s a feasible option.

It seems incredibly unlikely that the Budget Committee will be ready to mark up the spending blueprint this week. The committee needs to give a 48-hour warning before marking up a bill. And House GOP leaders will want to bring the budget to the floor the same week the committee marks it up.",2025-02-11T12:06:24+00:00,https://punchbowl.news/article/house/mike-johnson-to-brief-gop-on-budget-progress/,d428578e0bd144219f0c403132fb9a08

"Colman Domingo is already part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) as the voice of Norman Osborn in the animated series Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. However, speculations about Marvel wanting to recast the character of Kang the Conqueror, previously portrayed by Jonathan Majors, with Domingo have been going around for a while. In a recent interview, the Selma star revealed that he had spoken to Marver higher-ups about Kang and other prospective roles.

Colman Domingo on talks with Marvel about Kang’s recasting rumors

Domingo spoke about his involvement in the MCU during an interview with Josh Horowitz of the Happy Sad Confused podcast. When Horowitz said that they needed to get Domingo into the MCU, the actor pointed out that he was already part of the fictional world before acknowledging that Horowitz was referring to a live-action appearance. He added while it was “cool” to portray the iconic Spider-Man antagonist in animation, he’d love to essay the character in live-action projects.

When Horowitz brought up the Kang rumors, Domingo stated that “when it was constantly in the press and on places like Twitter (known now as X),” he wondered whether it was true and spoke to his team. Although he stated that his team denied that they had any conversations about him playing Kang in the MCU, he went on to add that interactions on the subject did happen. “We did follow up with a sitdown meeting with the heads of Marvel. So I did do that,” he added.

Domingo explained that during the interactions with Marvel, they discussed “openly about the landscape of Marvel or even the Kang rumors.” The Euphoria actor expressed reluctance to play a character previously portrayed in the same fictional universe by another individual. “I’m just all about energy and I just want to do things that make sense and bring gentle energy, but I feel like I want a role to be mine, whatever that role is, whatever I develop,” he stated.

Domingo hinted at his disinclination of joining the MCU as a recast. “I want to build something from the ground up that’s my own. So I feel like that was never a conversation from my point of view,” he added, before reiterating that he wanted to build something of his own.

Notably, Marvel removed Jonathan Majors from all of its upcoming projects in late 2023 after the actor was convicted of reckless assault in the third degree and found guilty of harassment against his former girlfriend Grace Jabbari.",2025-02-11T12:14:59+00:00,https://www.superherohype.com/news/592737-kang-recast-colman-domingo-marvel-talks-norman-osborn,26d20af5939642198201340d2f2ec010

"Federal investigators were working Tuesday to find out what led a pair of private jets to collide on a runway at a small airport in Scottsdale, Arizona, killing one person and injuring three others.

The crash occurred at Scottsdale Airport on Monday afternoon, when a Learjet arriving from Austin, Texas, veered off the runway and hit a parked Gulfstream jet, officials said, adding that it appears the plane's landing gear had failed.

The Learjet, which is owned by Mötley Crüe singer Vince Neil, had two pilots and two passengers on board, according to a statement. Neil was not on the plane at the time of the crash.

One person was aboard the other Gulfstream jet when the aircrafts collided. Officials have not publicly identified the fatal victim or those injured.

The crash is being investigated by the Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board.

The airport reopened its runway late Monday night, the facility announced on X.

The collision comes amid heightened scrutiny of U.S. air travel. Last week, 10 people were killed in a plane crash in Alaska. Last month, a Medevac jet crashed in Philadelphia, killing seven people and injuring more than 20 others. Days earlier in Washington, a passenger plane collided with a military helicopter, leaving 67 passengers and crew members dead.

"The City of Quatis has recently performed the installation of ovitras for monitoring the Aedes aegypti mosquito in the city. The initiative is a work of the Ministry of Health, through the Rio de Janeiro State Secretariat of Health (SES-RJ), in partnership with the municipal secretariats, which aims to combat the main cause of dengue, Zika and Chikungunya, through control and monitoring of mosquito outbreaks in the region.

Ovitrapa is formed by a black container, filled with water and carries an attractive beer -formed substance capable of attracting the mosquito. The object, which is positioned in a strategic place, simulates the conducive environment for breeding the insect. The Department of Sanitary and Environmental Surveillance (Visa) of Quatis, explains that the container contains a wooden palette facilitating that the female place the eggs and allowing the teams to obtain the right amount produced to define the mosquito population.

Following the collection and analysis of these palettes, the information is released in an application created by the Oswaldo Cruz Institute (Fiocruz), together with the Federal Center for Technological Education Celso Suckow da Fonseca (CEFET/RJ) and the Getúlio Vargas Foundation (FGV). The application allows an Aedes egg count optimization, besides producing heat maps, with the amount of eggs in ovitramps palettes installed in the municipality. Data enable health professionals to direct combat actions and strategies where there is the highest incidence of reproduction.

In Quatis, the ovitras were installed in 10 neighborhoods of the municipality. According to a survey conducted after 4 weeks, the survey pointed a total of 1,179 eggs collected in 20 installed traps. According to the data, the neighborhoods that showed the most outbreaks of the mosquito were Bondarovsky, with 145 eggs; St. Benedict, with 91; Water spread with 243; Garden Independence, with 112; In addition to the São José and Bairro Boa Vista allotment that had a close amount, with 183 and 184 eggs, respectively.",2025-02-11T12:00:00+00:00,https://quatis.rj.gov.br/prefeitura-de-quatis-instala-armadilhas-ovitrampas-para-monitoramento-do-aedes-aegypti-na-cidade/,f37f1d31483a4fd295d6c61b49762f60
"Former Pakistan captain Salman Butt has defended the lighting facilities at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore after New Zealand all-rounder Rachin Ravindra’s injury. Ravindra was badly injured while attempting a catch as he was hit straight on his face during the first match against Pakistan in the ongoing tri-nation series.

The Kiwi cricketer, who was stationed at deep square leg, attempted to catch the ball after it was hit by Khushdil Shah towards him. However, he lost it under lights, which resulted in a gruesome injury leaving him bleeding profusely. As a result, Ravindra had to be immediately taken off the field. Following the incident, several fans and pundits criticised the lighting facilities at the newly renovated stadium in Lahore.

However, Butt was quick to defend the facilities at the ground, arguing that the New Zealand batters had no problems in hitting fast deliveries for sixes while batting under the same lighting conditions. He also said that Ravindra got injured due to his misjudgement, or he might’ve slipped.

""There's no point trying to make people understand when they don't want to. It's irrelevant. These are some of the latest LED lights that have been installed, so these are fine. When New Zealand players hit sixes off deliveries bowled at close to 150 kph, were the lights not working then? A player who was standing 70 meters away failed to take the catch because of his misjudgment. He is a fine fielder, but perhaps his leg slipped, and he got hurt,” said Butt in a show Zor ka Jor on Samaa TV Tuesday.

Meanwhile, Ravindra’s injury could prove to be costly for New Zealand heading into the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 set to begin from February 19. New Zealand Cricket (NZC) recently gave an update on his injury and revealed that he sustained a laceration to the forehead. The board also mentioned that Ravindra came through his first HIA (Head Injury Assessment) well and will continue to be monitored under HIA processes.

Meanwhile, New Zealand have already sealed their spot in the final of the tri-series after commanding victories against Pakistan and South Africa, who will compete for a spot in the final in the last fixture on February 12.",2025-02-11T12:18:49+00:00,https://www.indiatoday.in/amp/sports/story/cricket-salman-butt-defends-gaddafi-stadiums-lights-after-rachin-ravindras-injury-2678321-2025-02-11,95fc3524254d4151bea09ea8dcf77dc2
"The U.S. Senate on Monday took a major step toward confirming Tulsi Gabbard as the Director of National Intelligence, moving her nomination forward in a sharply divided vote. The procedural vote, known as cloture, passed along party lines, with 52 Republicans supporting the motion and 46 Democrats opposing it. Two senators were absent.

The approval clears the way for a final confirmation vote, expected to take place at midnight on Tuesday unless an earlier agreement is reached. If confirmed, Gabbard will take charge of the nation’s intelligence agencies at a time of growing global threats and domestic political tensions.

Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman and 2020 presidential candidate, was nominated by President Donald Trump after switching to the Republican Party last year. She previously served as a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve and has been a vocal critic of U.S. foreign policy, often challenging intelligence assessments on issues such as Syria’s use of chemical weapons and the origins of the war in Ukraine.

Her nomination has faced intense opposition from Senate Democrats, who argue that her past statements and positions raise concerns about her ability to lead the intelligence community impartially. Despite these objections, her confirmation remains likely, given Republican control of the Senate.

The vote on Gabbard’s nomination marks the latest in a series of contentious appointments by the Trump administration. Once her confirmation process concludes, the Senate will shift its focus to another high-profile nomination: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services. Kennedy, a longtime critic of vaccines and public health mandates, has also sparked controversy ahead of his confirmation hearings.

"Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Karim Badawi met with ADES CEO Mohamed Farouk and ADEs Egypt Country Manager Ahmed Mohy to discuss the company’s exploration and production (E&P) work.

The meeting reviewed ADES’ work status in the field of drilling exploratory and production wells in the Abu Redis area and the Gulf of Suez area, as well as the plans for drilling exploratory and development wells targeted during the coming period, which will contribute to opening new horizons for increasing crude oil production rates.

During the meeting, Badawi praised the efforts of the company, the work teams and the spirit with which they work, which he witnessed during his visit last November to the Ras Badran field in the Abu Redis area, which was able to use the latest technologies and advanced techniques to achieve success stories that contributed to increasing the rates of crude oil production from this area during the recent period. Badawi noted that ADES is a good model for cooperation and that the results it has recently achieved will contribute to attracting new investments in research and exploration activities.

For his part, Farouk praised Badawi’s support for the company, as well as the full cooperation and coordination with the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC), which contributed to the company achieving these successes.

Farouk explained that the company has an ambitious plan to increase exploratory and development well drilling operations in light of the promising petroleum evidence and promising results for increasing production rates in its operating areas during the coming period.",2025-02-11T12:09:28+00:00,https://egyptoil-gas.com/news/ades-to-boost-ep-activities-during-coming-period/,3a3cc004208e42268e3b9ae8598e215f
"The average completion time for bridging loans decreased by 23% year-on-year, dropping from 58 days in 2023 to 47 days in 2024.

This reduction reflected the increasing maturity of the bridging finance sector, with both lenders and broker introducers demonstrating enhanced operational capabilities.

Despite economic uncertainties in 2024 fuelled by the anticipated general election, Budget and other macroeconomic factors, the bridging finance market showed remarkable resilience.

Total gross lending stayed relatively consistent at £822.2m, just 1% below the historic high of £831m recorded in 2023, making it the second-highest lending volume since 2015.

The average monthly interest rate saw a modest increase to 0.88%, up from 0.86% in 2023. This reflectecd a measured adjustment to the broader economic environment while maintaining competitive pricing for borrowers.

While interest rates saw a slight increase, the market maintained a balance between regulated and unregulated lending, indicating favourable market conditions.

Notably, the market witnessed changes in borrowing patterns, with auction purchases increasing from 7% to 11% of total loans, chain-break financing decreasing to 20% from 22%, and re-bridge falling to 7% from 9%.

This increase in auction purchases and decrease in chain breaks, according to the report, suggested a growing awareness and utilisation of bridging finance among landlords with investors increasingly turning to bridging finance for investment opportunities.

While decline in re-bridging transactions signalled improved market conditions and borrower confidence, with more borrowers successfully exiting their initial bridging loans.

MT Finance head of lending bridging finance Raphael Benggio commented: “The 2024 Bridging Trends data paints a picture of a robust, resilient market that continues to adapt and thrive despite external pressures. With faster completion times and steady lending volumes, these results show how bridging finance has evolved from an alternative solution to an essential component of the UK property finance landscape.”",2025-02-11T12:16:22+00:00,https://www.mortgagefinancegazette.com/lending-news/bridging-finance/mt-finance-data-shows-stronger-bridging-finance-market-11-02-2025/,67f04942a0da45209ffd8a7ccf6fc474
"Private equity is playing an increasingly pivotal role in Africa’s energy sector, driving growth and innovation in the continent’s oil and gas markets. This week, specialist energy private equity firm Bluewater announced the sale of Apex International Energy – transformed under its stewardship into a leading player in Egypt’s energy market – to a subsidiary of Hong Kong-listed United Energy Group. The transaction underscores the full-cycle nature of private equity investing and its potential to unlock value in Africa’s resource-rich markets.

Bluewater, which invested in Apex in 2018 as part of its second fund, saw the opportunity to develop the Houston-based company into a significant contributor to Egypt’s oil and gas industry. Under Bluewater’s stewardship, Apex grew from a small, independent exploration and production company into a top-ten producer in Egypt. Over the course of six years, Apex expanded its portfolio to include interests in eight concessions, with production averaging over 11,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2024.

This transformation was driven by strategic acquisitions, new discoveries and a laser focus on operational excellence. Key milestones included the 2021 oil discovery in the Southeast Meleiha concession, which saw first production later that year. In 2023, Apex expanded its footprint with the acquisition of six concessions in Egypt’s Western Desert from Italian energy giant Eni, as well as began first gas production. These strategic moves not only boosted Apex’s production levels, but also reinforced its position as a key contributor to Egypt’s energy security.

For Bluewater, this growth was a result of carefully managed investments that allowed Apex to capitalize on Egypt’s favorable energy market while navigating the complexities of local regulations and political landscapes. By taking a hands-on approach to governance and working closely with Apex’s leadership team, Bluewater was able to foster a culture of growth and innovation that delivered tangible results.

The sale exemplifies how private equity firms complete the full investment cycle – starting with identifying a promising asset, nurturing its growth and ultimately realizing value through a sale or exit strategy. In this case, the sale to United Energy Group positions Apex for continued growth and expansion under new ownership, while providing Bluewater with a profitable return on its investment. This model of buying, growing and exiting is at the heart of private equity’s role in driving value creation and economic development in emerging markets like Africa.

The transaction also underscores the increasing confidence that private equity investors are placing in Africa’s energy sector. Despite challenges like fluctuating commodity prices and complex regulatory environments, the energy sector in countries like Egypt offers substantial growth opportunities. For private equity firms, the continent’s untapped reserves, coupled with a growing demand for energy, make it an attractive destination for long-term investments.

Looking to the future, the role of private equity in African oil and gas is expected to grow further. The upcoming Invest in African Energy Forum in Paris will serve as a key platform for private equity firms to explore investment opportunities in Africa’s growing energy sector, where strategic partnerships and capital infusion are driving innovation and growth. In particular, firms that focus on full-cycle investment strategies – such as Bluewater’s approach with Apex – are well-positioned to thrive in this evolving landscape. They can bring capital, technical expertise and a deep understanding of local markets, enabling them to navigate challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities in Africa’s energy sector.

"Former President Joe Biden spent four years suing Republican-led states over border crackdowns that defied his federal policy. Now, President Donald Trump is turning the tables — taking sanctuary states and cities to court in an attempt to force compliance with his own federal immigration enforcement.

Last week, the Trump administration filed a lawsuit against Illinois, Chicago, and Cook County, challenging local laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The administration argues that these sanctuary policies obstruct federal enforcement efforts and prevent agencies such as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from carrying out their duties effectively.

Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor, told the Washington Examiner that sanctuary jurisdictions are at a major disadvantage in this legal battle. “Sanctuary cities have an uphill legal battle stopping Trump or even slowing him down,” Rahmani said. “Some issues like immigration are exclusively controlled by the federal government, so there is little that states can do to slow down (or speed up) immigration enforcement. The conservative Supreme Court handed the Biden administration multiple wins on this issue.”

Rahmani pointed to the Constitution’s supremacy clause, which establishes that federal law overrides conflicting state or local laws. “To the extent that state and federal laws conflict, under the Constitution’s supremacy clause, federal law controls,” he explained. “The blue cities’ best chance of challenging Trump is to argue that a federal law or executive order violates the Constitution, such as birthright citizenship or impoundment.”

Even if cities succeed in court, Rahmani added, Trump still holds significant leverage. “The problem with any legal challenge is that even if it’s successful, Trump and the Republicans in Congress can withhold federal funding to pressure California to bend to their will. The sanctuary cities are in a bad position and have little leverage here.”

In its complaint, the Trump Justice Department pointed to a landmark Supreme Court case that established the federal government’s dominance over states when it comes to immigration.

“Based on its enumerated constitutional and sovereign powers to control and conduct relations with foreign nations, the Federal Government has broad authority to establish immigration laws, the execution of which States cannot obstruct or take discriminatory actions against,” the Justice Department wrote in its complaint, citing the 2012 Supreme Court Arizona v. United States.

The Arizona case affirmed more than a decade ago that immigration enforcement is an exclusively federal function, barring states from enacting laws that directly conflicted with federal priorities. While the decision gave Biden a legal tool to challenge state-led border enforcement efforts, pro-enforcement advocates were unsuccessful with litigation efforts to weaken the reach of the Arizona precedent during his administration, when states including Texas argued they should have greater authority when the federal government refuses to act.

John Yoo, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley, told the Washington Examiner that Biden’s legal victories reinforced the notion that immigration is solely a federal issue. “In both cases (Biden v. Texas 2022 and United States v. Texas 2023), the courts are policing the line of federal power versus states’ rights in immigration,” Yoo said.

“The question is not the review, but the substance of the law. Here, the law has favored the Obama/Biden approach — in Arizona, the Supreme Court said not only that immigration is a federal issue, but that it is so exclusively federal that states have no authority to enforce it too,” Yoo added.

Now, Trump is testing how far he can push the courts in the other direction, flipping the logic of Arizona against sanctuary jurisdictions. “Biden and Obama used that rule to attack anything states did, like Texas, to enforce immigration law or police the border. Trump can be said to try to extend the rule to require states to help the federal government when it needs it,” Yoo explained.

Biden’s DOJ repeatedly leaned on the Arizona precedent to counter state-led immigration enforcement efforts. In Biden v. Texas (2022), the Supreme Court ruled that Biden’s administration had the authority to terminate the Trump-era Migrant Protection Protocols, also known as the “Remain in Mexico” policy, reinforcing the executive branch’s power to set immigration policy.

A year later, the high court ruled in United States v. Texas (2023) that Texas and Louisiana lacked standing to challenge Biden’s immigration enforcement priorities, allowing his administration to continue its approach to exercising discretion in executing deportations. The ruling emphasized the executive branch’s control over immigration decisions, stating: “In line with those principles, this Court has declared that the Executive Branch also retains discretion over whether to remove a noncitizen from the United States,” again citing Arizona.

If Trump persuades the Supreme Court to revisit Arizona, he could fundamentally reshape the balance of power over immigration enforcement. “I think his chances are quite high that he will win; none of the Justices in that majority are still on the Court,” Yoo noted, “while Republican-appointed members like Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Chief Justice Roberts were in the dissent.”

John Malcolm, vice president for the Heritage Foundation’s Institute for Constitutional Government, told the Washington Examiner that Trump faces different legal obstacles than Biden.

“One advantage Biden had is the Supreme Court’s dreadful decision in Arizona in which the Court held that state officials cannot pass laws that conflict with federal immigration priorities and enforcement efforts,” Malcolm said. “In that case, the state was taking proactive efforts to more rigorously enforce immigration laws that the federal government objected to.”

However, Trump’s attempt to force sanctuary cities into compliance faces hurdles. Hashim G. Jeelani, principal attorney at Jeelani Law Firm, PLC, told the Washington Examiner that the 10th Amendment protects states from being compelled to enforce federal laws, citing Murphy v. NCAA (2018).

Sanctuary cities are already using that legal argument in their pushback. San Francisco has filed its own lawsuit against the Trump administration, citing Printz v. United States (1997), which held that the federal government cannot commandeer state and local authorities to carry out federal directives. The Supreme Court reaffirmed this principle in City of Chicago v. Sessions (2018), when it ruled that the Trump administration could not withhold certain law enforcement grants from sanctuary jurisdictions without congressional authorization.

Trump’s lawsuit against Illinois signals that this fight is just beginning. Attorney General Pam Bondi has emphasized that more legal challenges are forthcoming against sanctuary jurisdictions that shield illegal immigrants from federal authorities.

And sanctuary cities are likewise preparing to push back, with legal experts such as Jeelani arguing that Printz and Murphy v. NCAA place limits on what the federal government can demand.

But with a conservative-leaning Supreme Court that has already overturned several long-standing precedents, Trump may see an opportunity to reshape immigration law in his favor.",2025-02-11T12:00:00+00:00,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/immigration/3315568/trump-adopts-biden-legal-playbook-challenge-sanctuary-cities/,164a7acf96be4f3bad2e0fd45a769b19
"At the latest meeting of North Berwick Community Council, plans were unveiled by AECOM and representatives from Law Primary School Active Travel Group, to members last Tuesday.

The aim of the new path – located north of North Berwick Law and south of Lochbridge Road, and running from Glenburn Road to Haddington Road – is to reduce school traffic, increase safety and support healthier choices for all living in North Berwick.

East Lothian Council is also helping to deliver the project, with a tarmacked path planned to replace the dirt track that is currently there.

The consultation on the North Berwick Active Travel Path ends on Monday; it is hoped that plans will then be submitted to the local authority by the spring.

If proposals are successfully approved by the council, construction of the new upgraded path could begin by this summer.

Euan Revell, of Law Primary School Active Travel Group, said: ""We have been trying really hard over the past few years to get the schools to think together to come up with a cohesive masterplan and having a pathway connecting it.

""We are trying to get kids off Lochbridge Road. The town has got bigger and has become more traffic dense, so we are advocating a path for a more safe route for pupils and residents as an active alternative.""

The route of the proposed path (Image: Supplied)

Andy Keba, a representative of AECOM who was present at the meeting, said: ""The main driving force behind this is to create a safe and accessible route to school by avoiding Lochbridge Road, which is normally very busy.

""This will give pupils the option, along with carers, parents, people in wheelchairs or even people with buggies, to have an accessible path.

""At the moment, the path isn't accessible for everybody, as there are rocks and uneven surfaces.

""We are hoping more people use this to alleviate the pressure off Lochbridge Road.""

An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: “The project is being delivered by East Lothian Council and partners AECOM, alongside the Law Primary School Active Travel Group, with the aim of improving the path facilities connecting Haddington Road to the Lochbridge Road play area, as well benefiting the residents of Glenburn Road to the east.

“A safer, more inclusive and attractive route to the play area, Law Primary School, North Berwick Sports Centre, and the surrounding residential area would be created under this scheme.

“We are going through the design process at present and will be seeking funding opportunities to begin construction next year.”

Kenny Miller, chair of North Berwick Community Council, said: ""It will certainly be good to keep children away from the roads on their way to school, but the junction where it joins Law Road needs further consideration, and it's a pity this path doesn't extend to the east to link Lime Grove and the three estates on the Dunbar Road.""",2025-02-11T12:00:00+00:00,https://www.eastlothiancourier.com/news/24912921.north-berwick-new-path-planned-pupils-residents/,21a28cec98fe458f8a1e2a8902a3950e

Portfolio Receipts is defined as the sum of Royalty Receipts and Milestones and other contractual receipts. Royalty Receipts includes variable payments based on sales of products, net of contractual payments to the legacy non-controlling interests, that are attributed to Royalty Pharma.

Milestones and other contractual receipts include sales-based or regulatory milestone payments and other fixed contractual receipts, net of contractual payments to legacy non-controlling interests, that are attributed to Royalty Pharma. Portfolio Receipts does not include proceeds from equity securities or proceeds from purchases and sales of marketable securities, both of which are not central to Royalty Pharma’s fundamental business strategy.

Portfolio Receipts is calculated as the sum of the following line items from Royalty Pharma’s GAAP statements of cash flows: Cash collections from financial royalty assets, Cash collections from intangible royalty assets, Other royalty cash collections, Proceeds from available for sale debt securities and Distributions from equity method investees less Distributions to legacy non-controlling interests - Portfolio Receipts, which represent contractual distributions of Royalty Receipts, milestones and other contractual receipts to RPSFT and the Legacy Investors Partnerships. Distributions to RPSFT substantially ended in December 2023 when Royalty Pharma acquired the remaining interest in RPCT held by RPSFT.

Adjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow are non-GAAP liquidity measures that exclude the impact of certain items and therefore have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow are important non-GAAP measures used to analyze liquidity because they are key components of certain material covenants contained within Royalty Pharma’s credit agreement. Royalty Pharma cautions readers that amounts presented in accordance with the definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies or analysts. These non-GAAP liquidity measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for the analysis of Royalty Pharma’s results as reported under GAAP.

The definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow used by Royalty Pharma are the same as the definitions in the credit agreement. Noncompliance with the interest coverage ratio, leverage ratio and Portfolio Cash Flow ratio covenants under the credit agreement could result in lenders requiring the company to immediately repay all amounts borrowed. If Royalty Pharma cannot satisfy these covenants, it would be prohibited under the credit agreement from engaging in certain activities, such as incurring additional indebtedness, paying dividends, making certain payments, and acquiring and disposing of assets. Consequently, Adjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow are critical to the assessment of Royalty Pharma’s liquidity.

Adjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow are used by management as key liquidity measures in the evaluation of the company’s ability to generate cash from operations. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow when considering available cash, including for decision-making purposes related to funding of acquisitions, debt repayments, dividends and other discretionary investments. Further, these non-GAAP liquidity measures help management, the audit committee and investors evaluate the company’s ability to generate liquidity from operating activities.

The company has provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP liquidity measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, being net cash provided by operating activities in Table 4.

(1) Portfolio Receipts is a key performance metric that represents Royalty Pharma’s ability to generate cash from Royalty Pharma’s portfolio investments, the primary source of capital that Royalty Pharma can deploy to make new portfolio investments. Portfolio Receipts is defined as the sum of Royalty Receipts and Milestones and other contractual receipts. Royalty Receipts include variable payments based on sales of products, net of contractual payments to the legacy non-controlling interests, that are attributed to Royalty Pharma (“Royalty Receipts”). Milestones and other contractual receipts include sales-based or regulatory milestone payments and other fixed contractual receipts, net of contractual payments to the legacy non-controlling interests, that are attributed to Royalty Pharma.

Operating and professional costs reflect Payments for operating and professional costs from the GAAP statements of cash flows. See GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliation in Table 4.

(3) Portfolio Cash Flow is defined under the credit agreement as Adjusted EBITDA minus interest paid or received, net. See GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliation in Table 4. Portfolio Cash Flow reflects the cash generated by Royalty Pharma’s business that can be redeployed into value-enhancing royalty acquisitions, used to repay debt, returned to shareholders through dividends or share purchases or utilized for other discretionary investments.

(4) Capital Deployment is calculated as the summation of the following line items from Royalty Pharma’s GAAP statements of cash flows: Investments in equity method investees, Purchases of available for sale debt securities, Acquisitions of financial royalty assets, Acquisitions of other financial assets, Milestone payments, Development-stage funding payments - ongoing, Development-stage funding payments - upfront and milestone less Contributions from legacy non-controlling interests - R&D.

"KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 11 (Bernama) -- The Royal Malaysian Customs Department’s (Customs) success in increasing the nation’s revenue demonstrates that tax system reforms, transparent economic management, and the government’s strategies in curbing leakages have yielded impressive results. Congress of Unions of Employees in the Public and Civil Services (CUEPACS) president Datuk Dr Adnan Mat said this achievement reflects the government’s commitment to strengthen public administration as well as enhance integrity and professionalism in the civil service. “CUEPACS extends our heartfelt congratulations to the Royal Malaysian Customs Department for its outstanding achievement in collecting a net revenue of RM65.57 billion for 2024.

“This success not only proves the efficiency and dedication of civil servants in the country’s taxation sector, but also the result of effective economic and administrative policies under the leadership of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim,” he said in a statement today. Adnan also expressed his appreciation and congratulated Customs director-general Datuk Anis Rizana Mohd Zainudin for her excellent leadership in steering the department to this outstanding achievement. “As the recipient of the 2024 CUEPACS Outstanding Woman Award, this achievement is a clear testament to her capability and dedication in empowering the department and ensuring a more efficient and transparent management of the revenue,” he said.

Adnan said CUEPACS supported the government’s efforts in strengthening the Customs Department through the provision of human resources and advanced technology, such as digitalisation and automation systems, which will enhance tax collection efficiency and expedite administrative processes. In light of the department’s excellent performance, CUEPACS called on the government to continue placing its trust in civil servants to carry out the national development agenda. “The Royal Malaysian Customs Department’s success should serve as a model for other departments in enhancing public service effectiveness, thereby strengthening public confidence in the civil sector’s ability to manage national resources efficiently and with integrity,” he added.",2025-02-11T12:20:51+00:00,https://www.bernama.com/tv/news.php?id=2391548,292429d57f7d455c8e9f743581c8d8bf

"A British man found dead along with his wife in France had money troubles and was seen crying over a pension, it is reported.

The bodies of Andrew, 62, and Dawn Searle, 56, were found in the small hamlet of Les Pesquies, near the town of Villefranche-de-Rouergue last Thursday.

Questions about the couple's possible financial difficulties have emerged with local sources alleging it had taken Mr Searle over a year to settle a bill of several thousands euros, and he was spotted looking tearful in December amid issues with his UK pension.

French police are investigating the deaths of the couple with Dawn found in her pyjamas with a head injury while there are reports that Andrew was found hanging inside their home.

Prosecutor Nicolas Rigot-Muller previously said both had died a ""violent death. When asked if this could be a murder-suicide case Rigot-Muller said: ""It's being considered."" Investigators also revealed no weapons were found at the scene and no bullet or knife wounds were found in an initial examination of the bodies, according to a source close to the investigation.

It has been suggested they could have been murdered by hitmen due to Andrew's career combatting financial crime. But former colleagues yesterday dismissed the possibility, saying Andrew's work for banks would largely be anonymous.

The couple moved to France around 10 years ago and it is now understood that Mr Searle had financial difficulties with his rental business he set up in Les Pesquies which folded in December, 2023, with no accounts filed, according to publicly available documents, reported the Mail.

CCTV footage captured Mr Searle buying a chocolate bar and two Euro Lottery tickets from a tobacconist the day before the couple's bodies were discovered. Two neighbours said they saw Andrew having a heated phone call on Wednesday. Antoine Da Silva, a retired council worker, told how he saw the dad-of-two hurrying through the village and looking ""very worried"" while on the phone to his dad Fred.

But best friends of the pair have also said they had been living a ""happy"" and ""comfortable"" life in the rural countryside north of Toulouse. Two British couples, close friends of the Searles, were last night keen to put down the suggestion of suicide.

The Brit expats, who are in their late 60s and live in a nearby village, said: ""Us Brits, who knew Dawn and Andy very well, are certain this is not a murder-suicide. We saw them last at Christmas, they were absolutely normal. Life was good, why would they want to kill themselves?""

They also said it did not appear as though they had financial problems. They added: ""They weren't flashy by any means, but they were definitely comfortable and had it good out here. They were always travelling - they recently went to a family wedding in Goa, they went to South America for their honeymoon.

""Dawn's son Callum had a baby and Dawn went over there for that. And [she] had just come back from Scotland because her dad’s funeral was at the end of January. They were also still working - Dawn was a project manager and Andy still did some freelance work. “[And] they have a gite [holiday home] connected to the main house which they rented out and it was occupied most of the time which gave them a good income on the side."" The couple married in 2023, with Dawn's son Callum, a former Hollyoaks star, walking her down the aisle.",2025-02-11T12:10:41+00:00,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/brit-found-dead-french-home-34655792,8edd6ef6164a4d1fa1d6fabe58041987

"Bewley's Café on Grafton Street in Dublin was forced to partially close last month after the it was found that raw fish and ready-to-eat foods such as egg and mayonnaise were being vacuum packed in the same machine.

""The dual use of a vacuum packing machine for both raw and ready to eat foods presents a significant risk of ready to eat foods becoming contaminated with bacteria,"" an HSE inspector said in their report.

Additionally, the inspector noted no documented cleaning and disinfection procedure or a cleaning schedule for the vacuum packer. As a result, Bewley's was required to cease usage of the vacuum packing machine from 8 January until 17 January.

Bewley's was one of 11 food businesses to be served with either closure or prohibition orders in January, according to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).

Five closure orders were served under the FSAI Act, 1998 to Balam Ltd of Glasnevin, Dublin 11, Lismore Golf Club of Lismore, Co. Waterford, The Turk Grill in Sligo town, Ella's Heave Café in Dublin 1 and the external drinks storage room Milner's Rest Public House in Ballingary, Co. Tipperary.

A further three closure orders were served under the EU Official Controls in Relation to Food Legislation) Regulations, 2020 to Xpress Pantry in Dunshauglin, Co Meath, Indian Tiffins in Dublin 1 and Bewley's.

Milner's Rest Public House was also served with a prohibition order under the FSAI Act, 1998, as were La Citdel and M Tee Ventures, both located in Swords, Co. Dublin.

Reasons for enforcement orders issued in January included active cockroach infestation; rodent activity and droppings; damp and mould growth; and personal items such as shoes, a gazebo and a scooter in a food production area.

""Food businesses have a fundamental legal responsibility to ensure the food they produce is safe to eat,"" said Dr Pamela Byrne, CEO of the FSAI.

""The Enforcement Orders served in January highlight unacceptable breaches of food safety legislation, including inadequate pest control, poor hygiene standards, and a lack of proper food traceability. These non-compliances pose a serious risk to consumer health and also undermine confidence in the food industry.

""It is essential that all food businesses implement and maintain a robust food safety management system to prevent such violations. The law is clear, food safety is not optional, and food businesses that fail to comply will face enforcement action.""

"The Kwahu Traditional Council has offered support to traders affected by the recent fire at the Kantamanto Market in Accra. 

 

 The council donated GH¢200,000 to help cushion the victims and also assist them in rebuilding their businesses.

 

 The amount was presented by the Kwahu Adontenhene, Akyemfour Asiedu Agyemang III, who is also the Chief of Kwahu Abetifi.

 

 Rationale

 The Adontenhene, who spoke on behalf of the President of the council, Daasebre Akuamoah Boateng III, acknowledged that many Kwahu natives also conduct business in the market.

 

 “We heard about the recent fire outbreak and we know this is not the first time such an incident has occurred.

 

 Many of our people trade here, and we want to assure you that we have not abandoned you.

 

 That is why the chiefs have decided to support you with this donation,” he said.

 

 Nana Agyemang III urged the traders to use the funds wisely while calling for preventive measures to avert future disasters.

 

 He also appealed to the government to provide further assistance and protection for market traders, emphasising the role markets played in job creation.

 

 “This market has helped reduce unemployment, as many of our youth are working here.

 

 I also want to plead with the government to step in and support victims more while ensuring the safety of traders,” the chief added.

 

 Gratitude

 On behalf of the affected traders, an executive member of the Kantamanto Disaster Interim Management Committee, Aikins Boakye Mensah, expressed appreciation to the council for its generous support.

 

 “We thank God for how far He has brought us. We are grateful to the chiefs and the people of Kwahu for this gesture.

 

 “On behalf of the traders, I say thank you, and we appreciate this move. God bless you and strengthen the Kwahu Kingdom,” he added.

 

 Mr Boakye also appealed to corporate entities and philanthropists to come to their aid. 

 

 He proposed constructing a perimeter wall around the market to enhance security and prevent future fire outbreaks.",2025-02-11T11:30:02+00:00,https://www.ghanaweb.com/blogs/spencerwan/Kwahu-Traditional-Council-supports-Kantamanto-market-fire-victims-8956,67dde5df9f9d4c3f8f94f9d7ce1fad2a
"The wrong way to evaluate Lindsay Gottlieb and USC Much of the criticism Lindsay Gottlieb receives at USC is ridiculous and divorced from team goals and objectives

If you have good parents in your life, you surely heard mom or dad -- maybe both -- tell you something which shaped how you carry yourself as a person. Your parents, if they were good to you, likely gave this piece of life advice: ""There's a right way and a wrong way to do something."" Regarding USC women's basketball coach Lindsay Gottlieb, we are not going to say that the head coach is above criticism. She's not. She, like any other coach, is fair game for legitimate criticism. The key word: legitimate. There's never anything wrong with the act of criticism itself. Public figures subject themselves to criticism. They get paid good money and/or have a lot of power and responsibility. Scrutiny itself is good, even necessary.

The key is for criticism to be fundamentally fair, reasonable, informed, and ultimately accurate. If someone is doing a good job but can fix one specific part of her methods, just say that. Such criticism would be accurate and fair.

Criticism which eviscerates a public figure without giving that person due credit for successes and achievements is fundamentally unfair, imbalanced, and therefore inaccurate. It helps no one because it doesn't paint a picture of the truth of a situation, the reality on the ground in a larger context.

Want to criticize Lindsay Gottlieb? Fine. We can all agree she is not getting the most out of JuJu Watkins right now. When a star player goes into a prolonged slump, it's the job of the coach to figure out a Plan B to get the star back on track. Gottlieb wouldn't disagree. That's her big task heading into UCLA and, beyond that, March Madness.

What's not legitimate -- not fair, not accurate -- about the Lindsay Gottlieb criticism connected to JuJu Watkins is that Gottlieb is doing a bad job with the USC women's basketball team as a whole.

The team comes before the individual

Excuse me, but when did a 21-2 record, 11-1 in the Big Ten, become a ""bad"" performance from a head coach? Are we going to sit here and insist that losing one game to Iowa means the whole season is a failure or is somehow behind schedule? One loss in 23 games (the Notre Dame loss being completely different in terms of severity and overall circumstances, for various reasons) means a coach is not doing her job well? By that standard, South Carolina head coach Dawn Staley isn't doing a good job this season. You can see the pretzel-twisting logic involved here.

Lindsay Gottlieb's job is not just to coach JuJu Watkins or make sure JuJu scores a lot of points. Her job is to coach the whole roster, to win games, to compete for championships and Final Fours. 21-2, 11-1 in the Big Ten? That's pretty good. It's not perfect, but it's good. Yet, on Twitter, you would get the idea or impression that Gottlieb can't be bothered to run any offense or that she is neglecting her duties.

A reminder: Winning is hard. If it was easy, USC women's basketball would have made at least one Elite Eight from 1995 through 2023. It didn't. It took Lindsay Gottlieb to bring USC back to the Elite Eight in 2024, for the first time in 30 years. Now USC is once again in position to get a top-eight national seed (a top-two seed in the NCAA Tournament) and compete for a spot in the Final Four.

Can Lindsay Gottlieb do better with JuJu Watkins? Absolutely. When that legitimate criticism expands into the belief that ""Gottlieb is a bad coach getting bailed out by good players,"" we have to put a stop to such nonsense.

As mom or dad hopefully told you, there's a right way and a wrong way to do something. Want to know the wrong way to criticize Lindsay Gottlieb? Take one small fact and bend it all out of proportion. When Elite Eight-level performance is viewed as ""bad"" or ""deficient,"" we have a problem. We have an inability to be fair, accurate, or contextually reasonable.

Criticism can be intelligent and fair at the same time. Let's always strive for that, be it with Lindsay Gottlieb or anyone else.",2025-02-11T12:13:25+00:00,https://trojanswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/trojans/womens-basketball/2025/02/11/couch-commentators-fans-lindsay-gottlieb-usc-womens-basketball/78387046007/,fb78d4344be94be588977d1611415754
"As one of the world's largest breweries (based on revenue) Carlsberg has released its first integrated report. Carlsberg’s report highlights the company's ESG achievements, providing transparency for investors and stakeholders. The company is set on producing zero water waste whilst also providing a carbon footprint of zero.

Carlsberg Group's 2024 Annual Report highlights significant progress in ESG initiatives, as part of its 'Together Towards ZERO and Beyond' programme. The report states that the company has seen a 2% reduction in carbon emission at breweries since 2023 – a 58% decrease since 2015. The company aims to have a zero farming footprint, forming the initiation of regenerative agriculture pilots in France, the UK and Finland – hoping to expand to Denmark in 2025. Simon Boas Hoffmeyer, VP Sustainability & ESG at Carlsberg Group comments: “Our performance in 2024 is due in large part to the long-standing commitment to our ESG agenda, and our focus on creating impact through partnerships and collaboration. A prime example is in the area of packaging.

“We could not achieve a 76% collection and recycling rate of our bottles and cans without years of hard work in industry-wide partnerships for efficient deposit return schemes and recycling infrastructure across our markets. This is really what we mean when we say Together Towards ZERO and Beyond.” It's estimated that in the US, 30 billion cans end up in landfill every year. To help manage this, Carlsberg has achieved a 76% collection rate and recycling rate for bottles and can – a 4% increase since 2019. Carlsberg's packaging is 94% recyclable, reusable or renewable with an increase of recycled content in packaging to 43%. The global brewery company is also establishing new water replenishment partnerships in Asia – replenishing 16% of water consumed at breweries in high risk areas in India, Cambodia, China and Laos.

 For the first time, Carlsberg's financial and non-financial results are presented side by side, reflecting the company's commitment to integrating ESG into its business operations.

Ulrica Fearn, CFO at Carlsberg Group explains: “We have made great strides in recent years to weave ESG into the fabric of the business, ensuring that this essential work gets properly measured, tracked and embedded into our business planning processes. “Launching our first combined Annual Report is a great milestone on this journey, and a key enabler for reaching our targets.” In 2021, Carlsberg joined forces with WWF to help restore seagrass meadows around the UK coastline. The project allowed for consumers to donate to the project by buying special edition beer packs. The project is part of Carlsberg’s Together Towards Zero sustainability strategy, which includes targets to halve carbon emissions at its breweries by 2022.

The need for this partnership is because seagrass can absorb CO₂ up to 35 times faster than rainforests – when the seagrass is massed together in meadows. Another sustainable brewery company is Heineken, reducing its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 34% since 2018. Heineken's initiatives like switching from steam to hot water helped reduce the company’s water consumption by 20%. By 2030, inline with the Paris Agreement, the company aims to replenish 100% of water in high-stress regions by 2030.



Similar to Carlsberg, Heineken offers recyclable packaging but at a rate of 99%, including a goal of 50% recycled content by 2030. Like Heineken, stout brewery Guinness operates with 99.5% of its packaging being recyclable. Guinness also reuses its kegs for up to 30 years, emphasising the importance of a circular economy. With ESG performance now fully integrated into its business planning, Carlsberg is setting a benchmark for sustainable brewing.

"Gabrelian explains that Matias is evoking EU law, whose definition of a worker is broader than the one used in Dutch law. For example, interns are not considered workers for Dutch law, but they can be under EU law. The EU legal order takes precedence over the domestic law of its member states. “Put simply, it ranks higher. This is necessary to maintain the unity and consistency of EU law across all member states and strengthen the internal market in the EU,” says the lawyer.

According to EU law, a worker is a person who provides services to a company or individual under their supervision or direction in exchange for remuneration. The question is whether serving on a university council fits this definition. ""It is debatable whether the element of supervision exists within the council or in the relationship between the council and the Executive Board,” says Gabrelian. After all, an element of supervision could undermine the independent role of the council member as well as their ability to properly fulfil their duties.

“On the other hand, Matias was required to attend meetings at set times, draft memos, provide advice and so on. So, even if the element of supervision is lacking, Matias could still be considered a migrating self-employed person under EU law,” Gabrelian argues. Self-employed workers provide services to companies or individuals without necessarily being under someone’s supervision or direction.



 UU Council chair Wim de Smidt supported Matias' application, especially because the student was so committed he devoted ""considerably more time"" to the council than the average 28 hours. He and the Executive Board provided Matias with letters confirming the activities performed for the council, how many hours those activities required, and how much he was compensated for them. However, De Smidt’s letter is clear: “He is not an employee of Utrecht University.”

De Smidt explains in an e-mail to DUB: ""As soon as UU grants student council members a salary, those student members become UU employees and then have to give up their seats on the University Council. In other words, for the University Council to function properly, students must be students.""



 The district court ended up ruling in DUO’s favour. The judge concluded that Matias was not engaged in economic activities for the university, as the payment he received was based on the study delay he would incur due to his time spent in the council, rather than the time and effort spent performing his duties.

The letters provided by the university indicate that the payment is directly linked to the time spent on the board. Additionally, student council members are expected to continue their studies alongside their council work, and many members do not experience study delays. Furthermore, the Court of Justice of the European Union has clarified that remuneration can take virtually any form, including government-issued student financial aid.

The expectation to stay enrolled, to which Gabrelian refers, does not constitute an obligation. Student members have the option to serve on the council without being enrolled , which is convenient in exceptional cases. Those who choose that option do not pay tuition fees and therefore do not receive the basic student grant. Paying tuition fees is a prerequisite for receiving the basic grant.

The lawyer is also disappointed that the district court did not seek guidance from the . “This is particularly striking given the absence of clear case law from the Court of Justice on this matter and the significance of positions like the one Matias held.” According to him, the Court of Justice has consistently applied a broad interpretation of the concept of work, aiming to promote cross-border activities within the EU. “Migrating workers and students like Matias are the cornerstone of the EU,” Gabrelian emphasises.

Matias is equally frustrated about the ruling. “Dutch students receive a basic grant just for being students, no questions asked, while Europeans must work. According to the principle of equality, as a European citizen, I should have the same rights as a Dutch citizen,” he argues. He and Gabrelian plan to appeal the decision before the Central Appeals Court ( ), the highest court in social security matters in the Netherlands.",2025-02-11T12:08:28+00:00,https://dub.uu.nl/en/depth/european-students-are-not-being-treated-equally,b008b6dddaed4f2284439057b032b11f

"Starling Bank has axed the 3.25% interest rate on its current account, a popular feature amongst its 3.6 million customers. The change took effect on Monday, February 10, ending the opportunity for customers to earn interest on funds in their current accounts. Prior to this, the digital bank offered 3.25% interest on balances up to £5,000, allowing customers to earn an additional £162.50 per year at the maximum. However, this feature is no longer available. Instead, the bank launched an easy access savings account with a 4% Annual Equivalent Rate (AER) on deposits of up to £1million. Like other traditional easy access accounts, savers can access and withdraw money when they need to without incurring a penalty.

A spokesperson said: “We regularly review our products so we can be the best bank we can be and help our customers achieve their financial goals. Whilst we've removed the interest on current accounts - which was notified to customers in November 2024 - customers can still benefit from the other award-winning current account features. “We learned from our customers that what they wanted was a separate account for their savings. So, we launched our easy saver, which enables them both to earn interest on bigger balances and to move their money without penalty.” They added: ""All Personal Current account customers can apply for an Easy Saver account. However, opening an Easy Saver account is subject to meeting eligibility criteria."" Alastair Douglas, CEO at TotallyMoney, noted that while customers can benefit from higher returns with Starling Bank's new savings account, they’ll need to manage their accounts strategically to maximise these benefits. He said: “Starling regularly tops the polls for being one of the best British banks and has seen consistent growth in the current account market with 3.6 million customers now holding £11billion in deposits. The good news for die-hard Starling fans is that the bank has launched an Easy Saver, which gives customers unlimited access to their funds, with an interest rate of 4.00% AER on up to £1million.”

He noted: “That way, you can still use the Starling account day-to-day, but you’ll just have to be a bit more savvy when it comes to moving your money between accounts to get the most out of the bank.” While the bank no longer offers an attractive interest rate on its current account, it does have other redeeming features. For example, customers can benefit from fee-free spending abroad. They can also use virtual jars, called “spaces,” to organise their money into different savings pots to better budget. People can also opt-in to ‘round-ups,’ which add spare change to their “spaces” jars to boost savings. The bank offers an entirely digital experience, providing only in-app access and monthly spending insights.

"Princess Anne received heartbreaking news from King Charles as the monarch honoured a key royal figure over his hard-working sister.

The Princess Royal is ""not permitted"" to use a special royal privilege, unlike Kate Middleton, who was recently appointed to a major role by the King.

The Princess of Wales has been allowed to issue Royal Warrants, which made her the fourth member of the royal family to cherish this opportunity.

King Charles, Queen Camilla and Prince William already have the power to issue Royal Warrants to people and companies that regularly supply goods or services to the royal household for at least three years.

Royal commentator Brian Hoey highlighted that the mother of Zara Tindall is not allowed to use this perk.

As per Mail, he said, ""The late Queen did not allow [King Charles's] then-wife, Princess Diana, to award any warrants. Instead, she used to send hand-written notes in recognition of excellent service, which were equally cherished by the recipients.""

Brian added, ""Princess Anne is not permitted to send warrants, even though she is, arguably, the hardest working member of the Royal Family.""",2025-02-11T12:16:00+00:00,https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/1281703-princess-anne-receives-heartbreaking-update-from-king-charles,2ca17c782f594e1ba554aeab4683ea10
"The biker, from Hove, had been attending a concert by the London Philharmonic Orchestra at the Brighton Dome when his bike was taken.

He had parked his Yamaha Tracer outside the Church Street venue on February 1.

Despite having it chained it up, Howard checked on the vehicle several times during his visit.

He accounted for the bike at both 20.10 and 20.50.

However, when leaving the venue around 21.00, his bike was no longer there.

The biker, who only wanted to provide his first name, Howard, described the feeling when he realised what had happened.

“When I realised the bike was gone, I was shocked. It’s the disappointment that my main recreational vehicle has gone.

“It’s left me worried for other owners who want to use their bikes around the city. It almost makes the city a no go for riders after dark.”

He shared how important the bike was to him.

“As motorcyclists we all love our machines. Hardly any motorcyclist out there doesn’t rely on their machine or love it dearly. They’re almost loved like pets. They encapsulate our spare time.”

Howard told The Argus how riding was a big part of his life, taking bikes both across the UK and abroad.

He described the hobby as ‘life enhancing’.

Howard said: “As riders we are proud of our riding craft. I’m just desperate to get back to riding again. It’s been such a big part of my life for the past 30-40 years.

I have spent big chunk of my life spent on two wheels and this is the first time I’ve had any loss of this nature.”

Despite the loss, Howard remains hopeful that someone would have been a witness.

“This happened early on a Saturday evening, someone must’ve seen something.”

• The bearish outlook for the EUR/USD currency pair is still the strongest and it seems that the EUR/USD exchange rate will weaken again in a week dominated by tariff concerns, US inflation and Eurozone GDP data for the last quarter of 2024.
• At the beginning of this important week's trading, the EUR/USD fell towards the 1.0277 support level before settling around the 1.0300 level at the time of writing the analysis.
• Obviously, the currency pair's losses increased as investors reacted to US President Donald Trump's message before the start of trading that new tariffs will be imposed this week.

The US administration is determined to pass the tariffs

In this regard, the US President announced that he will impose 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports and that other tariffs will be announced in the coming days. Following the developments, “Treasury yields rose on inflation concerns and financial markets reduced the chances of seeing a second rate cut by the Federal Reserve this year. Also, the US dollar rose broadly.”

Trump stated that he would announce additional tariffs later in the week in response to those imposed by other countries on US imports, opening the door to tariffs on the European Union. In response, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said that the European Union should not hesitate to defend its interests, telling TF1 television that ""the time has come"" for the EU to pull the trigger on retaliatory measures.

The European official added, ""That's what Donald Trump did in 2018, and we responded. And we will respond again. is ready to pull the trigger when the time comes. And now is the time. No one is in anyone's interest to start a trade war with the European Union.""

How will these tariffs impact the euro-dollar?

The mutual tariffs are now at stake, and this portends further weakness in the performance of the EUR/USD currency pair and a break of the 1.02 support will be the closest to that. On the economic data front. The US inflation data tomorrow, Wednesday, is the most prominent. The headline reading is expected to record 0.3% on a monthly basis, which would raise the annual rate to 2.9%, and the core inflation to reach 0.3% on a monthly basis.

Any reading above this is likely to give the dollar some strength and push the EUR/USD pair below 1.03. On the other hand, a drop below the upper limit would weigh on the US dollar as it stabilizes the expectations of “hawkish” interest rates and increases hopes for more rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve this year.

Overall, the US inflation data will come on the heels of some better-than-expected US jobs and wages figures released last Friday, limiting the room available for the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, ultimately supporting US bond yields and the US dollar.

On the monetary policy front, keep an eye on comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to lawmakers on Tuesday and Wednesday. We know he is keen to pause the rate hike cycle amid policy uncertainty, but his response to any questions about tariffs could be important in determining how the Fed handles the matter.

The euro remains under selling pressure, which weakens any attempts by the European currency to rebound higher

Looking at the European side of the equation, we will be watching for European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde’s speech at the start of the week and Isabel Schnabel’s speech on Tuesday. Both are expected to reiterate expectations that the ECB will “outperform” the Fed in 2025, confirming a divergence that has been a major factor behind the EUR/USD’s depreciation trend over the past several years.

Elsewhere, Eurozone employment data is due on Friday, with 0% quarterly growth expected, meaning no growth for the second consecutive quarter. Alongside this, employment figures are due to be released, with a 0.2% to 0.1% quarter-on-quarter decline. The Euro could come under pressure if the headline numbers come in below expectations, as this would reinforce bets that the ECB will cut interest rates more than currently expected.

Our technical outlook for the EUR/USD currency pair remains bearish. As mentioned earlier, the overall trend is still downward, and the bears have an opportunity to move towards stronger support levels. As we mentioned earlier also, breaking the support levels of 1.0245 and 1.0180 will accelerate the move towards parity for the Euro/Dollar sooner than previously expected. At the same time, all technical indicators will move towards oversold levels. We still expect a rapid evaporation of the Euro/Dollar's gains, and the closest resistance levels are currently 1.0410 and 1.0550. Decisively, the downward movement will continue until markets and investors react to the events mentioned above.

"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced today at the AI Summit in Paris that the EU plans to mobilize €200 billion for investments in artificial intelligence across Europe. This includes a new €20 billion European fund dedicated to AI gigafactories.

During her speech at the AI Summit, von der Leyen welcomed the European initiative “AI Champions”, which promises €150 billion in investments from providers, investors, and the industry. She also highlighted the new “InvestAI” initiative, which brings another €50 billion to the table—bringing the total AI investment package in Europe to €200 billion. “We will focus on industrial and mission-critical applications. This will be the world’s largest public-private partnership for the development of trustworthy AI,” she stated.

“Artificial intelligence will improve our healthcare, boost our research and innovation, and strengthen our competitiveness,” von der Leyen said, emphasizing that, alongside EU member states and partners, the InvestAI fund will mobilize unprecedented capital to develop European AI gigafactories. She also pointed out that this unique public-private collaboration, akin to CERN, will allow scientists and companies to develop cutting-edge large-scale AI models, essential for establishing Europe as a leader in AI. The Commission President underlined that while AI can be a gift to humanity, it is crucial to ensure that its benefits are widely shared and accessible to all.

Four AI Gigafactories to be Funded Across the EU

According to a statement released by the European Commission today, the InvestAI fund will finance the creation of four future AI gigafactories across the EU. These new AI gigafactories will specialize in training the most complex, large-scale AI models. Such next-generation AI models require extensive computing infrastructure to drive breakthroughs in critical fields such as medicine and science. Each gigafactory will house approximately 100,000 next-generation AI chips, nearly four times more than those in current AI factories.

The gigafactories funded through InvestAI will represent the largest public-private partnership for AI development worldwide. They will embody the European model of collaborative, open innovation, with a strong emphasis on complex industrial and mission-critical applications. The goal is to ensure that every company—not just industry giants—has access to large-scale computing power to shape the future.

How the InvestAI Fund Will Work

InvestAI will operate as a multi-layered fund, with different risk-return profiles. The EU budget will serve to de-risk investments from other partners. The European Commission’s initial funding for InvestAI will be sourced from existing EU financial programs with a digital focus, including Digital Europe, Horizon Europe, and InvestEU.

EU member states can also contribute by allocating funds from their cohesion policy budgets. The funding structure for AI gigafactories, combining grants and equity, will serve as a pilot model for strategic technologies under the “Competitiveness Compass” initiative.

AI Factories: The Largest Public AI Investment in the World

The European Commission had already announced the first seven AI factories in December, with five more to be revealed soon. The current AI factory support package, worth €10 billion, co-funded by the EU and member states, already represents the largest public AI investment worldwide. It is expected to unlock over ten times that amount in private investments. This initiative is also significantly increasing access to supercomputers for startups and industries.",2025-02-11T12:16:11+00:00,https://en.protothema.gr/2025/02/11/european-commission-the-eu-aims-to-mobilize-e200-billion-in-ai-investments/,5dfc8828b986491a863728bb5d008608
"Nintendo has announced that it is offering partial refunds on select items from the Nintendo Museum store, 'Bonus Stage'.

As reported by Sora News 24, Nintendo Museum Cookies, Pull-out Pikmin Cookies, and Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Polvorones are all subject to the refund offer, with Nintendo stating that an incorrect consumption tax rate was applied to all three.

Essentially, Japan has a 10% tax rate on all consumer products bar essential items such as food, which are subject to an 8% tax rate. Items such as alcohol were deemed to be non-essential and therefore subject to the 10% rate, while restaurant food was also considered luxury enough to be given the full 10% rate too.

It seems that the items in question here should have simply been given the 8% tax rate rather than the full 10% – understandable given that the fancy packaging containing the food could be considered non-essential, in a way.

As such, Nintendo is looking to offer customers a partial refund to cover the difference in price. Now, we're only looking at a maximum of 30 yen here, but if you're particularly frugal with your money and happened to have purchased one (or more) of these, then you might want to pursue the refund.

Here's a look at the full info from Nintendo:

It's not known exactly how long this has been the case, but it's possible that the items may have been incorrectly priced since the grand opening of the Museum in October 2024.

Needless to say, if you feel like you're due a refund from Nintendo (perhaps you bought these items in bulk as gifts), then you can fill in the request form via the official website.",2025-02-11T12:15:00+00:00,https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/you-may-be-due-a-refund-as-nintendo-alters-tax-rate-on-select-museum-gifts,a2d1847986dd434c8a233137bfbf0245

The Lagos-based private sector lobby group stated, in a business confidence survey done in collaboration with Stanbic IBTC, that the cost of doing business index declined to +47.58 in January from +50.32 in December, signalling reduced pressure on business growth.

“Exchange rate stability and moderated price increases led to a slower rise in operational costs and consumer prices,” the report noted.

The naira which has been steadily strengthening since the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) introduced the Electronic Foreign Exchange Matching Systems (EFEMS) and the FX code has been hovering around N1,500 to 1,520, bringing a glimmer of hope for businesses to plan.

Similarly, consumer prices have shown a decelerating trend on a month-on-month basis despite headline inflation soaring from 34.6 percent in November to 34.8 percent in December, 2024.

Prices are also widely expected to further decline on the back of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rebasing, giving a breather to businesses and households whose spending power has been hammered by rising prices.

The report noted that an increase in commercial activities at the start of the financial year was due to improved access to credit which rose +31.98. It however said high financing costs remained a critical constraint on both current performance and future growth expectations.

The NESG said frequent power shortages alongside limited foreign exchange availability, and restricted access to finance emerged as the most pressing challenges in January, constraining business expansion.

“These factors contributed to only weakly positive results in the general business situation (+44.82) and production levels (+23.74).”

It further stated that the high exchange rate of the naira against major trading currencies, alongside rising import costs, continues to erode profitability and disrupt pricing strategies.",2025-02-11T12:17:06+00:00,https://businessday.ng/news/article/naira-stability-crimps-business-costs-in-january/,d5d220f9d51d43d8bb182c2d71b694cc
"New Delhi, Feb 11 (PTI) The students at Jamia Millia Islamia are protesting against the university's disciplinary action against two PhD scholars, who were also served show-cause notices for allegedly organizing a demonstration last year.

The protest, which began on Monday, continues in the campus with students condemning what they call the administration’s ""crackdown on student activism"".

The university administration has not yet responded to their demands.

The disciplinary committee is set to meet on February 25 to review the role of the two PhD students in organizing ""Jamia Resistance Day"" on December 15, 2024, an annual event marking the 2019 anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests.

Holding banners with slogans like ""Dissent is the legacy of Jamia"" and ""Restore Campus Democracy"", students are demanding the withdrawal of the disciplinary action.

The protest is being led by Left-affiliated student organizations, including the All India Students Association (AISA) and the All India Revolutionary Students Organisation.

On December 15, 2019, Delhi Police allegedly entered the Jamia campus and baton-charged students inside the library while searching for ""outsiders"" during anti-CAA demonstrations. The crackdown led to nationwide protests.

AISA member Sonakshi told PTI that the protesters have four key demands: revoking the show-cause notices issued to the two PhD students, repealing the 2020 Office Memorandum that restricts protests on campus, scrapping the Rs 50,000 fine for graffiti and posters, and ensuring no future disciplinary action against students for participating in protests.

She also alleged that the administration had turned off campus lights, locked toilets and shut down the canteen since the protest began.

Some students claimed that restrictions on campus activism have intensified since Mazhar Asif took over as the vice-chancellor in October last year.

""We observed Resistance Day in 2023 without facing any disciplinary action, but in 2024, students received notices and inquiries were initiated,"" said Arpan, a member of AISA.

Our protest will continue till our demands are met and freedom of expression is restored inside the campus, he added.

"(Paris) Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promises a ""clear and firm"" response to the prices that President Donald Trump is imposing next month on all imports of steel and aluminum in the United States.

During a brief melee of press in Paris, where he participated in an international summit on artificial intelligence, Mr. Trudeau maintained on Tuesday that Canada was working with his ""international allies"" to organize the response.

""The prices offered on Canadian aluminum and steel are completely unjustified,"" he said.

The Prime Minister recalled that Canada aluminum and steel are ""an integral part of several American industries, such as defense, shipbuilding, manufacturing, energy and automotive.

""It makes North America competitive. It helps and American workers, and Canadian workers, ""he said.

Trudeau also stressed that the federal government will use the time it has before the entry into force of the prices to try to convince the Trump administration that customs duties would have negative consequences for the two countries.

President Trump signed a presidential decree on Monday to implement 25 % customs tariffs on all imports of steel and aluminum in the United States, as of March 12.

""I can tell you that our answer, obviously, will be clear and firm,"" said Mr. Trudeau.

The Prime Minister said he had ""initial conversations"" with the Allies of Canada about the response. He also mentioned his visit to Brussels on Wednesday, where he will meet the leaders of the European Union to speak, among other things, coordination efforts.

Asked in English, namely if his government could impose reciprocal customs duties ""dollar for dollar"", Mr. Trudeau replied: ""We hope that we will not get there. »»

Trudeau was also questioned by journalists, namely if he had spoken with the American vice-president, J. D. Vance, during an event organized on Monday evening on the sidelines of the summit on artificial intelligence. To this question, the Prime Minister did not offer a clear answer.

However, a high -level government source that has confided in the Canadian press said the two men have already spoken.

According to this source, Mr. Trudeau used this conversation to put forward the negative impacts that the prices in Ohio would have, where Mr. Vance was a senator until his position as vice-president.

MM. Vance and Trudeau will both witness a session of the summit for action on artificial intelligence later scheduled for Tuesday, during which the American vice-president will speak.",2025-02-11T11:26:53+00:00,https://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/politique/2025-02-11/tarifs-sur-l-acier-et-l-aluminium/justin-trudeau-assure-que-le-canada-ripostera.php,30ab7762d69446a3b3d062fe6a5ef029

"In the 15th minute of the contest at Espanyol’s Ciutat Esportiva Dani Jarque ground, Leon appeared to touch the front of fellow defender Caracas’ shorts with her hand as the pair marked each other, then said something to her.

Espanyol released a statement saying what had happened was “unacceptable”, that it had led to Colombia international Caracas receiving abuse on social media, and that they hoped “these types of situations are treated with the seriousness they deserve.”

Centre-back Leon, who played for Spain at the 2019 World Cup as well as the 2017 and 2022 European Championships, subsequently issued a statement of her own via Barcelona, saying: “At no time did I, nor was it my intention (to), infringe upon the intimacy of my fellow professional Daniela Caracas.

“As the images show, it was part of a playing action in which she deliberately touches me and I touch her leg saying in reaction to the clash: ‘What’s up with you?’ There is NO contact with her private parts, and certainly no intention.

“I insist, it was just part of the game that does not warrant the importance that has been attached to it. The idea of touching the private parts of a colleague would never enter my head, it goes against my principles and I would never do such a thing.”

Leon also condemned any harassment Caracas was receiving online, regarding which she offered her “most sincere support.”

And she added: “There has been noise and controversy surrounding my name, aimed solely at damaging my image and principles…I am deeply upset and disappointed, and hence reserve the right to take legal action against whomsoever might be seeking to exploit this strictly footballing incident to cause me damage and continue spreading unfounded accusations.”

Espanyol’s statement said: “We wish to express our complete discontent with, and condemnation of, the events that took place last Sunday…In this game, there was an action that we consider unacceptable and that should not be overlooked.

“During the match, FC Barcelona player Maria Pilar Leon, whilst jostling with Daniela Caracas, made a gesture with her hand that violated the privacy of our player.

“Although Caracas was unable to react at the time due to the impact of the situation, later, after assimilating what had happened, she became aware of the seriousness of the gesture, but chose not to react angrily in order to avoid a disciplinary sanction that would harm the team.

“In addition to what happened on the pitch, there was a regrettable response on social media, where our player was been the target of insults from hundreds of profiles.

“We defend our player and condemn any act that threatens the integrity of footballers on the field. We firmly believe in respect and sportsmanship as fundamental values ​​of football, and we hope that these types of situations are treated with the seriousness they deserve. In addition, we have made the club’s legal services available to our player in the event that she wish to take legal action.”

"ASHEVILLE, N.C. (WNCN) — On Monday, North Carolina Governor Josh Stein announced that Interstate 40 in the western part of the state will reopen two lanes by March 1.

This announcement comes after a visit by the U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy surveyed Helene Recovery in the area.

“Today, I am pleased to announce that we will reopen two lanes of I-40 by March 1,” Governor Stein said in the statement, “I am proud of NCDOT’s focus on this challenge and the roadworkers who have worked tirelessly to reopen roads and keep people safe. Reopening these lanes will help reconnect North Carolina and Tennessee and allow us to welcome back visitors to bolster the economy.”

During Secretary Duffy’s visit, he announced that the USDOT and U.S. Forest Services have partnered their efforts to help USDOT obtain a “special use” permit to use rock from Forest Service land to extract materials.

This partnership will allow the N.C. Department of Transportation to get construction materials from nearby rivers in western N.C. instead of transporting them from 20 to 50 miles away. This permit is a commonsense solution to reduce the time it would take to rebuild the highway and significantly cut down on costs

“President Trump directed me to build infrastructure faster, better, and more affordably,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. “That is why, when we recently identified a path to reduce I-40’s construction costs and timeline by as much as two-thirds of the original Biden-era estimate, I immediately asked my team what we could do to help. Today’s announcement will help ensure we deliver this critical project more efficiently for the American people. Too often, the federal government creates obstacles that slow recovery and drive up costs. This time, we’re cutting through those burdensome barriers to get the job done, ensuring USDOT’s full support for our state partner’s success every step of the way throughout this project.”

"THOUSANDS of Americans are being urged to check if they're eligible to claim payments up to $400 from a $2million appliance settlement.

It is now the final chance for those affected by the class action lawsuit to apply for the cash - and a simple receipt is all that's needed.

Bosch Home Appliances, manufactured by BSH Hausgeräte GmbH, is a German company that produces kitchen and home appliances.

The company is currently involved in a class action lawsuit with plaintiffs alleging its microwaves and ovens contained defective components that resulted in panel failure.

Bosch's products contained faulty variable-frequency drive, or VFD, control panels, per the settlement website.

Class members argued the design of the control panels resulted in the panels fading, dimming, becoming unreadable, or failing.

Bosch denied wrongdoing but agreed to pay $2 million to resolve the settlement, but time is running out to claim the payments.

The class action lawsuit benefits those who purchased select Bosch products, acquired them as part of a home purchase or remodel, or received them as a gift.

Eligible Bosch products include microwaves or ovens with the following model numbers:

Under settlement terms, eligible class members may receive Tier 1(a), Tier 1(b), or Tier 2 benefits.

Tier 2 benefits involve a three-year extended service plan through which Bosch will replace failed variable-frequency drive control panels.

Acceptable documents include the model and serial numbers, receipts, checks, credit card statements, warranty registrations, photographs, repair communications, or service invoices.

Class action lawsuits offer groups of people, or 'classes,' a way to band together in court. These suits are often brought by one or a few people who allege a company or other entity has wronged a large group of people. When a suit becomes a class action, it extends to all ""class members,"" or people who may have similar complaints to those who filed the suit. Companies often settle class actions - offering payment to class members who typically waive their right to pursue further legal action by accepting money. These payout agreements frequently include statements by the defendant denying wrongdoing. Companies tend to settle class actions to avoid the costs of further litigation. Pollution, discrimination, or false advertising are a few examples of what can land a class action on a company's doorstep.

To qualify for benefits, class members must submit a valid claim form.

The cutoff to file a claim for Tier 1(b) or Tier 2 benefits is February 12, 2025.

"Ian Ferguson, who was working in his family business on the day a massive car bomb devastated the centre of the Co Tyrone town, told the Omagh Bombing Inquiry that his life was changed forever.

The inquiry has moved into a new phase and is hearing from witnesses and people who were injured in the 1998 Real IRA attack.

The public inquiry was set up by the Government to examine whether the explosion, which killed 29 people including the mother of unborn twins, could have been prevented by the UK authorities.

Giving evidence, Mr Ferguson said he was working in the Spick And Span dry cleaning business on the day of the bombing.

He said it was a “typical Saturday morning” and people in the street outside his shop were “happy and joyful”.

Mr Ferguson said that following an alert he was preparing to leave his shop when the bomb exploded.

He said: “The rails with the garments at the back of the shop fell to the floor. The smoke alarms and screaming started.

“The two girls I had working with me, they started to panic.

“I have a back yard so I took them out to ensure they were safe.”

Mr Ferguson said he took his staff members away from the scene and left them in the care of a police officer before returning to his shop.

He said he noticed that the engine of the car which had exploded was still on fire.

Mr Ferguson said: “I went back into the shop and took two fire extinguishers.

“Me and another gentleman, I don’t know who it was, started to put the blaze out.

“From that, it was just carnage, the screaming and crying, the smell of smoke, it was just terrible.

“I started then to help people, lifting them off the ground.

“I remember lifting a lady on to a piece of wood and using it as a stretcher to take her down the street.

“I don’t know how long but I spent most of the day carrying people.”

Mr Ferguson said he then went back to his shop to let his parents know he was safe but was so disorientated he could not remember their phone number, so called a friend to contact his parents.

He said: “I went back out to help again. There were people bleeding, so I brought towels, blankets, anything I could get from the shop to use as bandages to help people.

“I don’t know how long it lasted. I met the late Father (Kevin) Mullan on the street.

“He was giving people the last rites and I was putting sheets over them.”

He added: “I went home that evening, I can’t remember what time.

“I felt so thankful to be home. A lot of people went to town that day and never came home.”

Mr Ferguson told the inquiry he had been fighting against depression ever since and does not like to be in large crowds.

He said: “That day changed the whole layout of the street.

“I lost so many friends and colleagues who never came back to work.

“On a Saturday evening we would have met up after work and had a drink and talked about how our week went.

“That has never happened since because people have left.”

A barrister then read statements to the inquiry provided by two women, Valerie Hamilton and Edel Doherty, who were in Omagh when the bomb exploded.

Ms Hamilton was working in a shop when she was told by police she needed to evacuate.

Recalling the moment the car bomb detonated, she said: “There was a flash and an immense heat, I put my hands up to my head and I shouted ‘no!’.

“The bomb had exploded. The next thing I knew I was sitting at Shop Electric on the pavement, in the foetal position with my hands still up at the side of my head.

“I don’t know how I got there.

“When I opened my eyes all that I could see was the smoke and debris everywhere and the smell of burning.”

Ms Hamilton suffered serious eye injuries, a fractured hand and multiple shrapnel wounds and still suffers from hearing loss and anxiety.

Her statement said: “I take medication to help with anxiety caused by what I saw that day because what I saw can never be unseen.

“It causes me so much stress and tension that I have chronic pain as I relive that day every day.”

Ms Doherty’s statement said she had been shopping in the town.

After the explosion, she made her way towards the town centre to search for a family member.

She said: “I was approached by a policeman, he asked if I had any first aid training.

“I followed him into Boot’s chemists where he directed me to lift anything which would absorb blood, like nappies or sanitary products.

“I proceeded to run, carrying the products towards the area of the bomb.

“It was chaos. People were screaming, crying and I remember meeting ash-covered faces. I could only see their eyes.

“There was a horrible smell and alarms were ringing constantly.”

Ms Doherty said she found a young boy lying in the street.

She said: “He was lying on his back, he was conscious, his eyes were open but he was not talking.

“I knew his injuries were severe and beyond my skills to fix.

“There was a door lying nearby. We used this as a stretcher.”

She said she placed the boy in the rear of a police Land Rover.

She said: “The sights that I saw that day remain with me to this day.

“They were horrendous, body parts, pieces of flesh, broken bodies and water and blood gushing down the street.

“Casualties with clothes blown off them, the walking wounded wandering around like zombies.”",2025-02-11T12:13:09+00:00,https://www.northwalespioneer.co.uk/news/national/24926365.omagh-bombing-survivor-tells-inquiry-placed-sheets-victims-bodies/,de94a70d8a5648bd98f712fa7927d5ab

"TORONTO, Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Probe Gold Inc. (TSX: PRB) (OTCQB: PROBF) (“Probe” or the “Company”), is pleased to report results from the 2024 MMI soil sampling program on its 100%-owned Detour Quebec Project. The survey, totaling 2,451 MMI soil samples, has successfully identified strong gold and gold-copper trends, extending 15 kilometres southeast along-trend of Agnico Eagle’s Zone 58N gold deposit (Figure 1). SRK consulting is currently conducting a magnetic structural interpretation over the extension of the Zone 58N shear splay and soil sampling grid on Probe’s property. This data, combined with MMI anomalies and ground geophysical surveys, will guide follow-up drilling in the next exploration phase

David Palmer, President and CEO of Probe, states “Our ongoing exploration at Detour continues to showcase the district-scale potential of this project. The soil sampling program has defined promising gold and copper targets, indicating the potential for mineralized systems similar to Zone 58N-style high-grade gold mineralization. In 2025, we plan to expand the soil program, conduct follow-up geophysics, and drill-test the new targets we have identified. Given these strong results, Detour will be a key priority in our regional exploration strategy for 2025.”

In 2024, Probe completed a systematic MMI soil sampling survey totalling 2,451 soil samples, covering the Lower Detour Deformation Zone and Zone 58N shear splay extending from Agnico Eagle’s Detour project. The soil samples were taken at a spacing of 50 m along sampling lines spaced 200 metres to 400 metres apart and extend northward to cover the Lower Detour Deformation trend. The focus of the program was to identify additional zones of Au-mineralization and potentially higher-grade sources of gold along the Lower Detour Deformation Zone and Zone 58N shear splay. MMI soil anomalies delineated numerous subparallel trends extending to the east and west with several correlating with IP anomalies from the Company’s 2023 geophysical survey, which have yet to be drill-tested.

The latest MMI soil sampling survey continues to improve the prospectivity of the Detour project. SRK Consulting has performed a structural analysis of the high-resolution aeromagnetic survey conducted in 2020 and data has shown good correlation of structures to Au mineralization. To date, fault structures (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th order) have been established from the data. The objective of this structural analysis of the project is to improve the structural and geological understanding of the Au mineralized zone, looking at the geometry of structures and distribution of fault/shear zones, and generations of folds. The study covers the extension of the Zone 58N shear splay and Lower Detour Deformation Zone on Probe’s property. The structural interpretation, MMI survey, drilling and IP surveys will be used to identify highly prospective areas associated with Au-mineralization for an upcoming drilling program that is currently in preparation.

The discovery stage Project covers an area of 777 square kilometres along the Detour Gold Trend, including the La Peltrie property option, the Gaudet-Fenelon JV property, the wholly owned Detour Quebec Main and North properties, and is located 190 kilometres north of Rouyn-Noranda and 40 kilometres northwest of the town of Matagami, Quebec, and hosts the Sunday Lake, Massicotte and Lower Detour Lake gold deformation zones. Both the La Petrie JV and Gaudet-Fenelon JV properties are in partnership with Midland Exploration Inc. The Project is located along the lateral extensions of Canada’s second largest gold mine at Detour Lake, operated by Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd., and recent high-grade gold discoveries in Zone 58N, Fenelon/Tabasco, Area 51 and Martiniere/Bug Lake made by Balmoral Resources Ltd. and subsequently their acquirer Wallbridge Mining Company Ltd. on their land package adjacent to the northern boundary of Probe’s property.

The scientific and technical content of this press release has been reviewed, prepared and approved by Mr. Marc Ducharme, P.Geo, Vice President Exploration, who is a ""Qualified Person"" as defined by National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (""NI 43-101"").

All 2024 MMI soil samples were collected under the supervision of Probe employees. At each sample site a small pit is dug to evaluate the soil profile, the sample is extracted using an auger, placed in the sample bag with a numbered tag to maintain chain-of-custody and closed with a zip tie until it reaches the laboratory for analysis. Approximately 500 g of material is extracted at an average depth of 10-15cm below the organic/inorganic interface as outlined by SGS Canada MMI sampling protocol. At each sample site a GPS location, photograph, sample site characteristics and sample composition is documented. A strict QA/QC program was applied during sample analysis; which includes a field duplicate every 50 samples and insertion of mineralized standards and blank samples for each batch of 50 samples. Samples were sent to SGS Canada in Burnaby, BC for Mobile Metal Ion (MMI) leach using Inductively Couple Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis on 50 grams of material completed using 55 multi-element geochemical package.

Probe Gold Inc. is a leading Canadian company focused on the acquisition, exploration, and development of highly prospective gold properties. The Company is well-funded and dedicated to exploring and developing high-quality gold projects. Notably, it owns 100% of its flagship asset, the multimillion-ounce Novador Gold Project in Quebec, as well as an early-stage Detour Gold Quebec project.

"Bhopal, Feb 11 (VOICE) Madhya Pradesh Urban Development Minister Kailash Vijayvargiya on Tuesday said the state government has deployed ministers and other public representatives to look after the pilgrims who are stranded due to the heavy rush of devotees.

The minister said the issue was discussed during the Cabinet on Tuesday, and Chief Minister Mohan Yadav informed that along with MLAs and officials from district administrations, local BJP workers have also been asked to come forward to help the stranded pilgrims going to Prayagraj’s Maha Kumbh Mela.

Vijayvargiya said that BJP President J.P. Nadda has asked the party’s state unit chief and the governments to ensure that pilgrims going for Maha Kumbh do not suffer and those stuck in long traffic jams, should be provided possible help.

Subsequently, Deputy Chief Minister Rajendra Shukla has been appointed to take stock of the situation.

“Deputy Chief Minister Rajendra Shukla is monitoring the situation between Satna to Rewa’s Chakghat border. Local BJP leaders have also come forward to support the administration,” Vijayvargiya told media persons.

He added that several pilgrims have taken the jungle route, and some of them have been separated from their family members.

“Police teams have been deployed to find them. BJP workers are helping district administration in distributing food, water, medicines and milk for stranded pilgrims between Satna and Prayagraj border,” said Vijayvargiya.

He further added that the medical camps and food stalls have been set up along NH-27 (from Satna to Chakghat border in Rewa district).

“Due to safety reasons, the vehicles have been permitted to move in the direction received from the authorities from Prayagraj due to which vehicles have been stopped at several places,” he said.

The minister said that Satna, Rewa, Mangawan, Gangeo, Garh, Teonthar and Chakghat (on NH-27) have seen huge traffic snarls due to the heavy rush of pilgrims.

“With thousands of devotees heading to the Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj stranded on various highways in Madhya Pradesh due to massive traffic jams, Chief Minister Mohan Yadav Monday has asked pilgrims to put off their travel by a few days to ease congestion. As a deluge of vehicles make their way to Prayagraj for the ongoing Maha Kumbh, heavy traffic jams spanning several kilometres have paralysed roads in Madhya Pradesh’s Jabalpur, Seoni, Katni, Maihar, Satna, and Rewa districts.",2025-02-11T12:24:06+00:00,https://weeklyvoice.com/maha-kumbh-mp-dy-cm-monitoring-situation-of-stranded-pilgrims/,b4b012a83b404d019b4f3ec8b1cdc069
"MONTREAL , Feb. 11, 2025 /CNW/ – Canada’s aluminium industry finds unfair and highly disruptive the 25% tariffs announced by the US administration. “A 25% tariff on our aluminium going to the US will only hurt US jobs, US industries – including defence, automative, construction, and housing,” said Jean Simard , President and CEO of the Aluminium Association of Canada . “At a time when you want to keep the price of everyday goods down, and ensure good American manufacturing jobs, a tariff will only drive prices higher – hurting Americans in their pocketbooks and undermining the agenda the US government says it wants to achieve.”

Canada’s 9,500 Canadian aluminium workers produce the metal that is processed, transformed and fabricated into parts, components, and everyday products by more than 700,000 well-paid American manufacturing workers, generating more than $228 billion in economic output in the US economy alone.

Our economies are integrated because it makes sense, because it benefits workers, consumers, and communities on both sides of the border.

As we have done in the past, industry and governments will work hand-in-hand to maintain our domestic aluminium industrial ecosystem, a 100-year-old plus legacy, contributing to our collective defence and economic security.

We will continue working alongside our governments, our Ambassador and our Canadian industrial business and union colleagues, maintaining a united front.

We will also actively reach out to our stakeholders in the US – customers, entrepreneurs, businesses, workers, elected officials – whose daily livelihood thrives on the use of our metal.

Going forward the focus for our industry and our countries must be set on addressing the devastating impacts of unfair Chinese trading practices stemming from massive state subsidies on the entire aluminium ecosystem. These non-market policies and practices of the last two decades have hurt our workers and businesses, shuttered smelters, and made it harder for our responsibly produced metal to compete. Canada will not be a transshipment risk or a vector for trade practices that could harm our collective economic security.

We have been working very closely with US government and industry to align our trade tool kit to protect fortress North America , including the most recent implementation of 25% surtax on imports of China’s aluminium products. Other measures taken over the last five years include:

In 2024, Government of Canada provided $10.5 million over three years for the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) to create a dedicated Market Watch Unit. Creating a new regime to address circumvention and providing more flexibility to apply higher dumping duty rates when there are market distortions. Creating and implementing in 2019 an Aluminium Imports Monitoring System. Developing and implementing the world’s first and only operating aluminium digital traceability system, ensuring real-time tracking of metal shipments coming out of the gate. This is why Canadian aluminium must remain exempt of any tariffs, because of its strategic role within North America’s integrated industrial value chain. While the US produces, at best, one million metric tons a year of primary metal, it consumes six times that amount. Imposing tariffs will only raise costs for US consumers and businesses in the middle of inflation reduction efforts.

About the Aluminium Association of Canada

"MONTREAL , Feb. 10, 2025 /CNW/ – Unifor condemns Bell’s shortsighted workforce reduction plans that will potentially cost another 1,200 workers their jobs.

“Workforce reduction plans are a damaging stunt to temporarily reduce costs, making profits appear higher on the backs of workers. Bell cannot keep cutting jobs every year and expect the ship to turn itself around,” said Unifor National President Lana Payne . “Canada is potentially facing a trade war with the U.S., and Bell has chosen to once again leave Canadian workers unemployed in part to satisfy its move into the American market.”

Bell announced its $7 billion acquisition of Ziply Fiber in November 2024 , following a year of devastating cuts to its Canadian workforce. Bell has indicated it intends to meet with union representatives this week to discuss voluntary separation packages and retirement incentive offers.

“Job reductions bleed talent and increase stress and anxiety among Bell workers. The company loses by letting go of experienced workers, and the customer loses by relying on a smaller and smaller team of Bell employees to build and deliver services,” said Daniel Cloutier , Unifor Quebec Director.

“The question that we’re all asking is, ‘where does it end?’ After a few more years of this Mirko Bibic will look up and realize that Bell Canada is just three contractors in a trench coat, and by then it will be too late,” continued Payne. “At some point, someone at Bell has got to put forward a long-term plan that actually includes investing in Canada’s workers again.”

This move follows decades of hollowing out Bell’s workforce, including an October 2024 announcement to cut 120 jobs at Expertech, a June 2024 50-person job cut at Bell Media, a February 2024 4,800 person job-cut, a 1,300-person cut in June 2023 , and many more.

In early 2024, Unifor launched the Shame on Bell campaign to call on the company to stop its contracting out and offshoring of telecom jobs, stop slashing Canadian newsrooms and reduce dividend payouts to reinvest in employee wellbeing, infrastructure, and job security.

Unifor is the largest private sector union in Quebec and Canada, representing more than 320,000 members in all sectors of the economy. Unifor fights for the rights of all workers. It also fights for equality and social justice at home and abroad and aspires to bring about progressive change for a better future. In Quebec , Unifor represents nearly 55,000 members and is affiliated to Quebec’s largest central labour body, the Fédération des travailleurs et travailleuses du Québec (FTQ).",2025-02-11T12:24:16+00:00,https://weeklyvoice.com/r-e-p-e-a-t-unifor-condemns-bells-workforce-reduction-plan-amid-national-crisis/,d4ddc477cade424385763999e2264a77
"VANCOUVER, BC , Feb. 11, 2025 /CNW/ – Golden Arrow Resources Corporation (TSXV: GRG) (FSE: G6A) (OTCQB: GARWF), (“Golden Arrow ” or the “Company “) is pleased to announce that the Company and Mogotes Metals Inc. (“Mogotes Metals “) have agreed to amend (the “Amending Agreement “) the previously announced option on the Mogote Copper-Gold Project, in San Juan Province, Argentina (the “Project “). The Amending Agreement grants Mogotes Metals an option to acquire a 100% interest in the Project (the “Amended Option “) in exchange for CAD$1 million in a combination of cash and a private placement into the Company, plus a substantial equity interest in Mogotes Metals and a 1.5% net smelter returns royalty (“NSR “) on the Project. To date under the previous option, Mogotes Metals has completed the minimum exploration expenditures at the Project.

Nikolaos Cacos , Golden Arrow’s Vice President Corporate Development commented, “We are very pleased to further monetize our Mogote Project in a way that increases both the short-term value and long-term potential returns. We will be able to deploy the cash assets to advance exploration at our active projects in Argentina and Chile , particularly the exciting San Pietro copper-gold-iron-cobalt project where an initial mineral resource estimate is currently being completed. At the same time, we retain strong upside potential from the NSR, and the interest in Mogotes Metals who will continue exploring in this highly-prospective district adjacent to the prolific Filo del Sol copper-gold-silver trend.”

Golden Arrow is also pleased to report that Hanaq Argentina S.A. (“Hanaq “) has secured permits and commenced diamond drilling at the Company’s Caballos Copper-Gold Project in La Rioja Province, Argentina , under the terms of the option agreement announced on March 9, 2021 . The project is in a porphyry copper-gold and epithermal gold-silver district at the intersection between the south end of the Maricunga Copper-Gold Belt with the northern extent of the El Indio Gold-Silver Belt, approximately 23 kilometres north of Lundin Mining’s Josemaria Project. This is the first time that the prospective targets at the property have been drill tested. The initial program is expected to include 3 holes totaling approximately 1,000 metres. [Proximity to a mineral resource, deposit, or mine does not indicate that mineralization will occur on Golden Arrow’s property, and if mineralization does occur, that it will occur in sufficient quantity or grade that would result in an economic extraction scenario.]

Brian McEwen , Golden Arrow VP Exploration and Development stated, “We are pleased to see advanced exploration permitting and drilling at Caballos, which reflects the recent positive shift in support for exploration from the authorities in La Rioja. Our strategy of optioning non-core assets like Mogote and Caballos is starting bear fruit, and we look forward to a productive year ahead from our joint-venture partners as well as at our own portfolio of core exploration prospects in Argentina .”

Mogotes Metals will pay $550,000 in cash to the Company on the date (the “Initial Closing Date “) that is five days following the TSX Venture Exchange’s (the “TSXV “) conditional approval of the transactions contemplated by the Amending Agreement (together, the “Transaction “);

Mogotes Metals shall purchase such number of units of Company (each, a “Unit “) on the Initial Closing Date through an investment (the “Investment “) of $450,000 in Company by way of a private placement financing at a price equal to the greater of (i) $0.05 per Unit and (ii) the maximum discounted price for the Units acceptable under the rules and policies of the TSXV, with each Unit consisting of one common share in the capital of Company (each, a “Share “) and one warrant of the Company (each, a “Warrant “) for gross proceeds of $450,000 . Each Warrant will entitle the holder to purchase one Share (each, a “Warrant Share “) at an exercise price of $0.08 per Warrant Share for a period of three years from the date of issuance (the “Private Placement “);

Mogotes Metals will issue common shares of Mogotes Metals (each, an “Option Share “) to the Company as follows:

10,714,285 Option Shares on the Initial Closing Date; and

such number of additional Option Shares (the “Deferred Option Shares “) having a value of $1,500,000 (the “Final Amount” ) to be issued on or before the first anniversary of the Initial Closing Date (such date being, the “Final Closing Date “) determined in accordance with the Amending Agreement, provided that, Mogotes Metals may satisfy this obligation by paying the Final Amount in cash to GRG on the Final Closing Date, in lieu of the Deferred Option Shares; and

Mogotes Metals will grant to the Company on the Final Closing Date a 1.5% net smelter returns royalty in respect of the Project. Pursuant to the Amending Agreement, the Company agrees not to transfer the Option Shares (the “Lock-up “), without the prior consent of Mogotes Metals, until such shares are released in accordance with the following schedule:

on the date that is six months following the Final Closing Date, fifty percent (50%) of the Option Shares will be released from the Lock-up; and

the remaining fifty percent (50%) of the Option Shares will be released from the Lock-up in equal monthly installments over the subsequent six-month period, such that all Option Shares will be fully released from the Lock-up on the 12-month anniversary of the Final Closing Date. In the event Mogotes Metals does not issue the Deferred Option Shares (or pay the Final Amount in cash) to the Company by the first anniversary of the Initial Closing Date (the “Option Deadline “), and provided Mogotes Metals has satisfied its other obligations under the Amending Agreement, Mogotes Metals will acquire an 80% interest in the Project as of the Option Deadline and the terms of the previously announced earn-in agreement will otherwise remain in effect.

Completion of the Transaction, including the Private Placement and the issuance of the Option Shares by Mogotes Metals, is subject to the approval of the TSXV.

"2,100 Homes Expected to be Powered by these Community Solar Projects

TORONTO , Feb. 11, 2025 /CNW/ – SolarBank Corporation (NASDAQ: SUUN) (Cboe CA: SUNN) (FSE: GY2) (“SolarBank” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce an update on the development of two projects located on industrial brownfield sites located in Skaneateles, New York which is in the Finger Lakes Retion of New York , in Onnodaga County. The Company intends to develop two ground-mount community solar projects across the this site with a capacity of 14.4 MW DC (the “Projects”). The Projects have achieved a development milestone in receiving positive interconnection results via a completed Coordinated Electric System Interconnection Review (CESIR). Now that the Company has received a positive interconnection determination, the next step is completing the permitting process for the Projects which is already underway. The Projects are expected to be eligible for incentives under the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (“NYSERDA”) NY-Sun Program.

Following receipt of the necessary permits and financing, the Company intends to commence the construction of the Projects. Once completed, each of the Projects will be operated as a community solar project. Community solar is a group of solar panels with access to the local electricity grid. Once the panels are turned on and generating electricity, clean energy from the site feeds into the local power grid. Depending on the size and number of panels the project has, dozens or even hundreds of renters and homeowners can save money from the electricity that is generated by the project. By subscribing to a project, a homeowner earns credits on their electric bill every month from their portion of the solar that’s generated by the project, accessing the benefits of solar without installing panels on their home. This allows homeowners to realize a reduced cost per kW/hour from the power they consume versus standard utility rates.

There are several risks associated with the development of the Projects. The development of any project is subject to receipt of a community solar contract, required permits, the continued availability of third-party financing arrangements for the Company and the risks associated with the construction of a solar power project. In addition, governments may revise, reduce or eliminate incentives and policy support schemes for solar power, which could result in future projects no longer being economic. Please refer to “Forward-Looking Statements” for additional discussion of the assumptions and risk factors associated with the Projects and statements made in this press release.

SolarBank Corporation is an independent renewable and clean energy project developer and owner focusing on distributed and community solar projects in Canada and the USA . The Company develops solar, Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) and EV Charging projects that sell electricity to utilities, commercial, industrial, municipal and residential off-takers. The Company maximizes returns via a diverse portfolio of projects across multiple leading North America markets including projects with utilities, host off-takers, community solar, and virtual net metering projects.

Pre-Feasibility Studies (PFS) for Costa Fuego and Huasco Water nearing completion A$19 million in cash as of 31 December 2024

Hot Chili’s Managing Director Christian Easterday said: “La Verde is shaping up as Hot Chili’s next major copper-gold discovery, with the potential to significantly lift the scale of our Costa Fuego project. With primary copper supply declining, copper and gold prices rallying, and a PFS on each of our planned businesses (copper-gold and water) nearing completion – momentum is building fast.

Following in the footsteps of our successes at Cortadera and Productora, we’ve secured full control of La Verde after years of strategic consolidation, finally allowing us unrestricted access to test this historically overlooked porphyry system.

Drill results have exceeded expectations, revealing a much larger porphyry system than first recognized, with broad, consistent copper-gold mineralisation extending from shallow depths and largely hidden below shallow gravel cover.

This discovery has all the signs of becoming our third bulk-tonnage, copper-gold deposit, and is open in all directions and growing fast. We’re also preparing to deploy AI-powered exploration to fast-track our nearby exploration growth pipeline, leveraging 16 years of expertise in Chile .

With La Verde’s scale potential and the Costa Fuego copper-gold hub expanding, we’re at a major inflection point in Hot Chili’s growth story.”

PERTH, Australia , Feb. 11, 2025 /CNW/ – Hot Chili Limited (ASX: HCH) (TSXV: HCH) (OTCQX: HHLKF) (“Hot Chili” or the “Company”) is pleased to report a second round of strong assay results from its La Verde copper-gold discovery, located approximately 30km south of the Company’s Costa Fuego Copper-Gold Project (“Costa Fuego” or “the Project”) planned central processing hub at low elevation in the coastal range of the Atacama region, Chile .

Hot Chili has now completed 19 RC drill holes (5,700 m ) at La Verde, with assay results from 12 holes reported so far confirming a major copper-gold porphyry discovery in Chile’s coastal range.

Wide, shallow mineralisation – current discovery footprint extends 550 m by 400 m and remains open in all directions. Deeper potential remains untapped – Mineralisation commences from shallow depths, extends to more than 300m below surface, and 8 of 12 drill holes reported to date end in mineralisation at the limit of RC drilling depth capability. Gravel cover masking potentially much larger porphyry system – step-out drilling underway. Potential below the historical oxide copper open pit untested – drill testing yet to commence. Major discovery in its infancy – every drill hole has intersected porphyry-style, copper-gold mineralisation (refer to Table 1 for details on significant intercepts). What’s Next?

More results coming – assays pending for seven additional RC holes, with geological logging confirming the presence of porphyry host-rock featuring porphyry-style A- and B-type veining in each of the pending drill holes. Diamond drilling being planned – targeting potential for deeper, higher-grade zones intersected at depth and to test potential for +1km vertical depth extent, typical of other recent major porphyry discoveries, such as Hot Chili’s neighbouring Cortadera discovery, BHP/Lundin Mining’s Filo del Sol discovery, ATEX Resources Valeriano discovery, and AMSA/Barrick’s Encierro discovery. Regular drilling news flow – the Company will continue to provide updates as new drill results are received and exploration at La Verde advances. This announcement is authorised by the Board of Directors for release to ASX and TSXV.

For more information please contact:

Notes to Table 1: Significant intercepts for La Verde are calculated above a nominal cut-off grade of 0.2% Cu. Where appropriate, significant intersections may contain up to 30m down-hole distance of internal dilution (less than 0.2% Cu). Significant intersections are separated where internal dilution is greater than 30m down-hole distance. The selection of 0.2% Cu for significant intersection cut-off grade is aligned with marginal economic cut-off grade for bulk tonnage polymetallic copper deposits of similar grade in Chile and elsewhere in the world.

1 Mineral Resources are reported on a 100% Basis – combining Mineral Resource estimates for the Cortadera, Productora, Alice and San Antonio deposits. All figures are rounded, reported to appropriate significant figures and reported in accordance with the Joint Ore Reserves Committee Code (2012) and NI 43-101. Mineral Resource estimation practices are in accordance with CIM Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Best Practice Guidelines (29 November 2019) and reported in accordance CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (10 May 2014) that are incorporated by reference into NI 43-101.

2 The Productora deposit is 100% owned by Chilean incorporated company Sociedad Minera El Aguila SpA (SMEA). SMEA is a joint venture (JV) company – 80% owned by Sociedad Minera El Corazón SpA (a 100% subsidiary of Hot Chili Limited), and 20% owned by Compañía Minera del Pacífico S.A (CMP).

3 The Cortadera deposit is controlled by a Chilean incorporated company Sociedad Minera La Frontera SpA (Frontera). Frontera is a subsidiary company – 100% owned by Sociedad Minera El Corazón SpA, which is a 100% subsidiary of Hot Chili Limited.

4 The San Antonio deposit is controlled through Frontera (100% owned by Sociedad Minera El Corazón SpA, which is a 100% subsidiary of Hot Chili Limited) and Frontera has an Option Agreement to earn a 100% interest.

5 The Mineral Resource Estimates (MRE) in the tables above form coherent bodies of mineralisation that are considered amenable to a combination of open pit and underground extraction methods based on the following parameters: Base Case Metal Prices: Copper US$ 3.00/lb, Gold US$ 1,700/oz, Molybdenum US$ 14/lb, and Silver US$20/oz.

6 All MRE were assessed for Reasonable Prospects of Eventual Economic Extraction (RPEEE) using both Open Pit and Block Cave Extraction mining methods at Cortadera and Open Pit mining methods at the Productora, Alice and San Antonio deposits.

7 Metallurgical recovery averages for each deposit consider Indicated + Inferred material and are weighted to combine sulphide flotation and oxide leaching performance. Process recoveries:

San Antonio – Weighted recoveries of 85% Cu, 66% Au, 80% Mo and 63% Ag. CuEq(%) = Cu(%) + 0.64 x Au(g/t) + 0.00044 x Mo(ppm) + 0.0072 x Ag(g/t) Alice – Weighted recoveries of 81% Cu, 47% Au, 52% Mo and 37% Ag. CuEq(%) = Cu(%) + 0.48 x Au(g/t) + 0.00030 x Mo(ppm) + 0.0044 x Ag(g/t)

8 Copper Equivalent (CuEq) grades are calculated based on the formula: CuEq% = ((Cu% × Cu price 1% per tonne × Cu_recovery) + (Mo ppm × Mo price per g/t × Mo_recovery) + (Au ppm × Au price per g/t × Au_recovery) + (Ag ppm × Ag price per g/t × Ag_recovery)) / (Cu price 1% per tonne × Cu recovery). The base case cut-off grade for Mineral Resources considered amenable to open pit extraction methods at the Cortadera, Productora, Alice and San Antonio deposits is 0.20% CuEq, while the cut-off grade for Mineral Resources considered amenable to underground extraction methods at the Cortadera deposit is 0.27% CuEq. It is the Company’s opinion that all the elements included in the CuEq calculation have a reasonable potential to be recovered and sold.

9 Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. The MRE include Inferred Mineral Resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorised as Mineral Reserves. It is reasonably expected that the majority of Inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to Measured or Indicated Mineral Resources with continued exploration.

10 The effective date of the MRE is 26 February 2024.

"Leading breast oncology experts to provide insight and guidance for clinical studies, market readiness, and pipeline development for cancer detection and treatment platform

CALGARY, AB , Feb. 11, 2025 /CNW/ – Syantra, Inc., a precision biotechnology company revolutionizing cancer detection and treatment, proudly announces Dr. Edith A. Perez as chair and Dr. Maria Theodoulou and Dr. Adetunji Toriola as members of the Scientific Advisory Board (SAB).

The board will work with Syantra leadership and advise on clinical testing and early commercialization of Onco-ID™ Breast, a blood test for early detection of breast cancer, as well as R&D and corporate strategy.

“We are very excited to have this incredible group of cancer luminaries join the SAB. Their expertise and experience link in well to our strategic initiatives and complement our team. We look forward to working together to advance our technologies and introduce the world to the test and the platform it was built on, Onco-ID™ ,” said CEO Rob Lozuk .

Onco-ID™ is Syantra’s patent-pending platform that helps the company take a new approach to early cancer detection. “Unlike most liquid biopsies on the market, which look for cancer in the bloodstream, Onco-ID™ leans into the body’s own immune system, identifying biomarkers that indicate the presence of early stage cancer. We believe this is an entirely new approach with extraordinary potential,” said Lozuk.

Edith A. Perez , M.D., Chair, SAB . An internationally recognized clinical translational oncologist, Dr. Perez holds the distinction of Professor Emeritus at Mayo Clinic with a career that has spanned academic and industry leadership in medical affairs, drug development, clinical operations, regulatory and medical affairs, pharmacovigilance, and biometrics.

At Genentech, she led a team of 150 healthcare professionals, spearheaded numerous clinical trials and scientific collaborations, and directly contributed to the successful launches of life-changing oncology therapeutics. During Dr. Perez’s 20-year academic and clinical tenure at the Mayo Clinic, she made deep contributions to the treatment of breast cancer and the advancement of translational biomarkers in collaboration and with funding from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the NIH, as well as leading Foundations such as the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. She has authored or co-authored over 700 peer-reviewed manuscripts and abstracts, was granted an endowed professorship, and served as Deputy Director at Large for the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center.

Maria Theodoulou , M.D. Recognized internationally for her impact on breast cancer care and the community, Dr. Theodoulou is a clinical oncologist and Program Director Breast Medicine with New York Oncology Hematology (NYOH). Prior to joining NYOH, Dr. Theodoulou was an attending physician at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and a Professor of Medicine at the Joan and Sanford Weill Medical College of Cornell University .

Komen for the Cure, Greater New York City , Outstanding Physician Award- Sass Foundation for Medical Research, Clinical Excellence & Community Advocacy in Breast Cancer- Brook Air Force Base, San Antonio, TX , and the AXIOS Award from American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association’s Cancer Foundation.

Adetunji Toriola , M.D., PhD. Dr. Toriola is internationally recognized for his research on the molecular basis of breast cancer. He is Professor of Surgery at Washington University School of Medicine and has a multidisciplinary background in medicine (MD), public health (MPH), anesthesia (DA), and epidemiology (PhD). He is a William H. Danforth Washington University Physician-Scientist Scholar and co-leads the Cancer Prevention and Control Program at Siteman Cancer Centre. Dr.Toriola was recognized with the 2022 American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Outstanding Investigator Award for Breast Cancer Research.

"MONTREAL , Feb. 11, 2025 /CNW/ – JRTech Solutions has confirmed that the ” Well Made Here” logo can systematically be integrated into electronic shelf labels (ESL) for products duly accredited by this non-profit organization.

JRTech Solutions Inc. is Canada’s leading provider of ESLs and the world’s largest distributor of Pricer electronic labels, with installations in over 700 hardware stores and home improvement centers since 2008.

” Well Made Here / Bien fait ici ” was established under Canadian law on October 31, 2018 , through the initiative of about a hundred manufacturers, their sales networks, and several associations in the renovation and construction sector. Its mission is to promote the manufacturing and sale of hardware and construction materials that comply with building codes and standards, with at least 51% of production costs originating from Canadian factories. Currently, over 13,000 SKUs are accredited from more than 150 factories across all regions of the country.

Diego Mazzone , President and CEO of JRTech Solutions, explained the reasoning behind this initiative: “Consumers are more eager than ever to know the origin of the products they buy. With the logo easily integrated into our electronic labels, we can streamline the distribution of this information without requiring additional efforts from manufacturers or retailers.”

Richard Darveau , President and CEO of the ” Well Made Here / Bien fait ici” organization, emphasized the dual focus of the program he founded: “Certainly, the ‘Made Here’ aspect is crucial at a time when everyone wants to support local manufacturers. However, the ‘Well Made’ dimension of our label is just as important in countering low-quality products that flood the market with their low prices, potentially threatening the comfort and safety of homeowners and even the value of their properties.”

The implementation of this new partnership will span several weeks. Manufacturers will first need to provide universal product codes (barcodes) for all their products in a single file managed by ” Well Made Here.” The integration will then proceed with the consent of participating retail banners and buying groups.

It is worth noting that Canada designs and manufactures nearly all the hardware, materials, accessories, and technologies required for home construction or renovation. However, on average, only about 33% of the products on the shelves of hardware stores and home improvement centers are Canadian-made, with the remainder being primarily American, Asian, and, to a lesser extent, European products.

About Bien fait ici / Well Made Here

Bien fait ici / Well Made Here is a federally chartered non-profit organization collectively founded in October 2018 by several banners and professional associations. Bien fait ici / Well Made Here’s commitment is to ensure quality housing, from the cellar to the attic, with a raison d’être to encourage the purchase of quality building materials and other items manufactured in Canada and intended for the residential market. Bien fait ici / Well Made Here’s vision for the first few years is to strengthen the value chain between manufacturers, banners, and their network of hardware stores and home improvement centres to better serve consumers and building contractors.

"IND vs ENG 3rd ODI: England opener Ben Duckett doesn't care if they lose the ongoing three-match ODI series to India by 3-0 and just want to lift the 2025 Champions Trophy title. During an interaction with the Guardian ahead of the third and the last match, Duckett reckoned that the ODI series against India was just a preparation setup for them ahead of the upcoming mega-event, and it's the ICC title that they have set their eyes on.

The Jos Buttler-led side were seen struggling during their tour to India this time. They first lost the five-match T20I series by 4-1 and have also lost the ODI series as well. They have had a hard time posting mammoth targets, which their bowlers could have easily defended.

Even though they are struggling, Duckett is hopeful that they will be able to win in the mega event.

“We have come here for one thing, and that is to win the Champions Trophy. We still believe we can do that. Certain players are finding their feet and a bit of form. This is a massive series, but the Champions Trophy is the big competition. If we lose 3-0 to India, I don’t care as long as we beat them in the final in the Champions Trophy. No one will probably look back on this series if we go and do the business in that competition,” he said.

Kevin Pietersen also criticized Ducett for his lack of responsibility while batting in this format. Pietersen opined that the batters shouldn't feel satisfied after scoring just 50-60 odd runs in the 60-over format and then feel that they have done their job.

Duckett replied to Pietersen's criticism and admitted that he wasn't happy scoring 60 runs but had to take risks of playing against favorable match-ups in a game. He also revealed that their head coach would get mad for smacking the opponent bowlers towards the short boundary.

“You could knock it around for 15 overs and get myself a score,” Duckett said. “But it felt like he was the man I was going to take down to the short boundary. It didn’t come off. That’s what [McCullum] wants us to do. If I am facing a left-arm spinner, it’s not to knock it around and try and selfishly get myself a score. It’s trying to put him under pressure. If that goes for six, who knows? Me and [Root] bat longer, and we get 350 or something. Baz will never have a go at me for trying to hit a left-arm spinner for six over midwicket with a shot I play time and time again. As long as we are sticking to the options we practice, sticking to our strengths, there will be no complaints inside that dressing room,” he concluded.

The Jos Buttler-led side has been struggling since the last two ICC tournaments. They looked out of form during the 2023 ODI World Cup and also failed to defend their title at the 2024 T20 World Cup. They will aim to work on their weaknesses and the third and the last ODI against India, which will be held on Wednesday in Ahemadabad.",2025-02-11T12:20:00+00:00,https://english.jagran.com/cricket/india-national-cricket-team-vs-england-cricket-team-ben-duckett-comments-champions-trophy-10218037,cf501fe9598044478005e056727bda20
"The University of Alabama System held its 2025 Montgomery Drive-In last week. The event drew more than 80 members of the Chamber of Commerce of West Alabama and also local business leaders. The annual gathering is one of the chamber’s most popular public policy and advocacy initiatives.

According to chamber leadership, the trip promoted the organization’s legislative agenda and provided an opportunity for participants to meet with key leaders in state government while networking with other community leaders.

“It is important for us to understand the priorities of the legislature and advocate on behalf of our community through the legislative process,” said Chamber President and CEO Kyle South, a former representative of House District 16 in the Alabama House of Representatives. “Having a strong presence in Montgomery ensures that our collective voices are heard. We have great relationships with our delegation and look forward to working together for the betterment of all of West Alabama.”

Students from Anchor Tuscaloosa, a new talent retention initiative powered by Fuel Alabama, also attended the first day of the trip. In partnership with Visit Tuscaloosa, the Tuscaloosa County Economic Development Authority, and the Chamber of Commerce of West Alabama, this program gives students from the University of Alabama, Stillman College, and Shelton State Community College opportunities to grow personally and professionally while exploring life in Tuscaloosa beyond college.

On day one, attendees first traveled to the Alabama State Capitol to hear from State Finance Director Bill Poole about the state budget and the Ivey administration’s priorities. Following Poole’s presentation, the delegation met with members of West Alabama’s legislative delegation, including Sen. Gerald Allen, Sen. Bobby Singleton, Rep. Cynthia Almond, Rep. Bryan Brinyark, Rep. Chris England, Rep. Bill Lamb, Rep. A.J. McCambell, and Rep. Curtis Travis. Attendees also received a criminal justice update from Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall and Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles Director Cam Ward. After the session with the legislative delegation, participants attended the annual legislative reception hosted by the Business Council of Alabama, where they had the opportunity to network with elected and appointed officials from across the state.

Day two of the Montgomery Drive-In began with a session featuring Alabama Legislative Services Agency Director Othni Lathram, followed by workforce updates from Secretary of Commerce Ellen McNair and Secretary of Workforce Greg Reed. In the afternoon, the group observed the Alabama Legislature in session from the House and Senate galleries at the Alabama State House. The trip concluded with a luncheon at the RSA Plaza, where Alabama Superintendent of Education Dr. Eric Mackey provided an update on education.",2025-02-11T12:00:04+00:00,https://yellowhammernews.com/montgomery-drive-in-brings-chamber-members-to-capitol/,69c7e70e68a1401c8535de981740db27
"STARDOM finally uploaded this show to their streaming service about a week after it initially aired. Good crowd on hand for this one.

Azusa Inaba, Momo Watanabe, Rina and Thekla vs. HANAKO, Maika, Mina Shirakawa and Waka Tsukiyama

Is it just me or are there way more lights at this show? It seems like the entrances have more light show vibes to them and I dig it. So the main idea behind this match was to continue the Thekla/Maika story. It seems like Maika continues to take it easy on her former stablemate and that was the opening the HATE members needed to capitalize. Otherwise, this was your standard multi-woman tag with Momo and Mina kind of going at it while Rina and Azusa went after the New Blood Tag Champions. Some solid back and forth all around until we got down to Thekla and Maika. Maika overpowered her and had the upper hand but help from other HATE members changed that. Eventually, a shot from Momo’s bat led to Thekla’s finisher on Maika to end this at 12:20. A good little opener to the show. [**½]

Hina and Lady C vs. Mei Seira and Rian

Mei and Rian isn’t a team I think I’ve seen before but the duo of Hina and Lady C was part of the Goddesses of Stardom Tag League. There isn’t much to say about this one. Rian handled most of the action for her team, giving her something of a showcase while Mei mostly got a night off. They played this as Rian trying to navigate dealing with Lady C’s impressive size. I do think Lady C has improved a fair bit over the past year or so. As noted though, there was a lot of Rian in this which was good for her development but it doesn’t make for the most interesting of matches. She and Hina had the closing stretch to themselves, with Hina winning after hitting what looked like a fisherman’s Jackhammer at 10:06. [**¼]

I’ve enjoyed this little rivalry. Sure it’s mostly low stakes but it’s good fun and gives us a singles match on the undercard. Ranna nearly got sucked into the Koguma taunt to start, only to stop when she saw the disappointed look on Syuri’s face at ringside. The personalities of the two women in this is what made it work. Koguma is a fun, lovable goofball while Ranna is very stoic. Ranna may have to grow out of that over time but for now, putting her in there with someone so animated allows her to play the straight opposite like in a buddy cop movie. The entire match was based around comedy but in a good way. The action itself was good enough to carry the rest of the bout and I appreciated that Ranna came close a handful of times. I bit hard on a flash pin attempt down the stretch just before I then bit on Koguma winning via submission only for Ranna to get to the ropes. Koguma regrouped and won with a top rope splash in 11:16, capping a very fun match. [***¼]

Aya Sakura, Sayaka Kurara and Yuna Mizumori vs. Fukigen Death, Natsuko Tora and Ruaka

The Cosmic Angels trio made sure to jump the HATE girls. I always like it when babyface teams do that to stables like HATE and the House of Torture. They come across as smart rather than just a bunch of generic faces. Anyway, aside from the start of this and the spot where Sayaka got heat for interrupting Fukigen’s signature spots, nothing of note really happened. In the end, Fukigen rolled up Yuna to steal this in 7:41. Yeah, I didn’t write much because it’s the same thing we’ve seen a ton and wasn’t as fun/good as the HATE opener. Lame that this Cosmic Angels trio lost here after just putting up a hell of a fight for the Artist of Stardom Titles a few weeks ago. [**]

Hanan, Hazuki, Mayu Iwatani and Momo Kohgo vs. Kiyoka Kotatsu, Saki Kashima, Syuri and Tomoka Inaba

With just three matches left, this show needs a boost. Right now it feels like New Japan in that 85% of the card is kind of just there before you get two big matches at the end. That said, there’s potential here. The God’s Eye group is good and STARS is like prime LIJ in that even in unimportant matches, you can count on them to deliver. There was fun to be had early on with STARS taking turns chopping Kiyoka and Mayu doing a pose down and everything as a tribute to Saya Iida, who is on the shelf with an injury. God’s Eye had their own brand of antics, including a fun little spot where Tomoka slammed Momo onto the other members of STARS. Simple, yet effective stuff here. From there, it was quality back and forth with some focus on Syuri late. She and Mayu have had some notable interactions lately. I could see them running that back soon. In fact, it was Syuri who won with the Stretch Muffler on Momo at 11:51. That was a lot of fun. [***¼]

Post-match, the returning Konami jumped Syuri from behind. The rest of HATE joined her in on the beating. The Syuri/Konami feud has been very bad and needs to finally deliver in the ring to make it all worth it.

Artist of Stardom Championship: Natsupoi, Tam Nakano, and Saori Anou [c] vs. AZM, Miyu Amasaki, and Starlight Kid

Oh, this is loaded. There was high-octane action right from the opening bell and it almost never slowed down. There was so much to like here. Miyu Amasaki, as the least experienced, had a lot to prove but never backed down from Tam or Saori. Starlight Kid wrestled with a level of confidence fitting for someone on the run she’s on. Natsupoi reignited their end of 2024 feud with some hard-hitting exchanges in the middle of this. AZM reminded everyone that even though she hasn’t won anything major since dropping the High Speed Title, she’s still one of the best wrestlers in the company. The Cosmic Angels trio works so smoothly together, which makes sense since Natsupoi is in a damn good tag team with both partners. Meanwhile, AZM and SLK as partners feels right after their history. The spot where the champs hit a trio of Germans at the same time was dope but the challengers rallied and busted out some trios offense. We got a prolonged AZM/Saori back and forth that was excellent. I am all for AZM having a 2025 similar to Starlight Kid’s 2024. That led to the huge finish, with AZM beating Saori with the Azumi Sushi at the 18:12 mark. One of the best matches of the young year as everyone just went out there and put on a show. Tons of action, great bits of intertwining stories being told, and a welcome title change. This is the STARDOM I love. [****½]

World of Stardom Championship: Saya Kamitani [c] vs. Suzu Suzuki

The first title defense for Saya Kamitani and it’s against a former Grand Prix winner. Where the previous match started with a bang and didn’t slow down, this was worked at a more methodical pace. They were slugging it out to open rather than moving quickly from spot to spot. I love balance like that on a card. Saya then annoyed Suzu by continuing to bail outside and then hit a dive onto her, outsmarting the challenger. I liked that when Saya sat on a chair inside to taunt, Suzu responded by sitting in a chair outside and flipping her off. Big matches need personalities, not just people doing moves. Various HATE members gave Suzu the boot from the chair, which put Saya in the driver’s seat. Suzu didn’t stay down for long, continuing to level Saya with some vicious shots. This was one of those matches where it felt like the two participants genuinely didn’t like each other. Saya also was a hit with her heel persona, even going as far as to embarrass Suzu by pouring water over her head. Her underhanded tactics did well whenever she got into trouble trading blows with Suzu. They were going all in on big spots like the avalanche German Suplex. Suzu looked to capitalize on that with more suplexes but Saya kicked out. The final few minutes had some stellar exchanges from counters to straight-up strikes to each hitting a Poison Rana. In the end, Saya retained with the Star Crusher in 18:23. A fantastic main event that lacked a bit of drama since I couldn’t imagine Saya already losing. Still, this was filled with some great stuff and I’m intrigued by Suzu. She keeps losing these big matches (not as many as Hazuki) and is now the only member of her stable without a title. [****¼]

Post-match, after Saya talked some smack to Suzu, Tam Nakano came out. It seems like the Tam/Saya is happening at the next major show.",2025-02-11T12:00:08+00:00,https://411mania.com/wrestling/pantojas-stardom-supreme-fight-2025-review/,12d09a2c47b84f2f839bce04c52df53b
"The ICC Champions Trophy 2025 is going to start from February 19. After eight years, this prestigious tournament is going to return under the hosting of Pakistan. A total of 8 teams will be seen fighting for the title in this big tournament. The big match will be played between India and Pakistan on February 23.

The Indian team is considered to be a strong contender for this 50 over format tournament. Before this, let us know what is the position of all the 8 teams participating in the Champions Trophy 2025 in the ICC ODI rankings? Who is the number-1 ODI team?

The Indian team is currently the number-1 team in the ICC ODI rankings. India has maintained its dominance in the ICC ODI rankings for some time now. The current rating of the team is 119 and it is far ahead of the other teams. Before the Champions Trophy 2025, the Indian team is playing a three-match ODI series against England, in which the team has won the series 2-0 by registering brilliant victories in the first two matches.

The Australian team, which won the 2023 ODI World Cup, is currently ranked second in the ICC ODI rankings, with a rating of 113. There is a difference of 7 points in the rating between India and Australia. Australia won the 2006 and 2009 Champions Trophy. The Australian team will enter the field with the intention of winning this trophy for the third time in the Champions Trophy 2025.

Pakistan is currently at third place in the ICC ODI rankings. The team’s rating is 107. Pakistan is hosting the Champions Trophy 2025. In such a situation, the team can get the advantage of home conditions. Pakistan will have to play matches against India, Bangladesh and New Zealand in the group stage. The Pakistani team can give tough competition to the other teams.

New Zealand is currently at the fourth position in the ICC ODI rankings and its rating is 104. The New Zealand team is currently playing a tri-series in Pakistan. The team’s morale is high after winning matches against Pakistan and South Africa and it can give a tough challenge to the other teams in the Champions Trophy.

South Africa is currently at the fifth position in the ODI rankings, with a rating of 101. South Africa is currently participating in the ongoing tri-series in Pakistan. However, before this big tournament, the African team has the challenge of injured players. Many star players of the team have been ruled out of this tournament due to injuries.

The England team participating in the Champions Trophy 2025 is currently at number seven in the ICC ODI rankings. England’s current ranking is 92. However, before this tournament, the England team has faced continuous defeats. After losing the T20 series against India, they have also lost the three-match ODI series.

The Afghanistan team will participate in the ICC Champions Trophy for the first time. In the ICC ODI rankings, the Afghan team is at number eight with 86 points. The Afghanistan team, full of great players like Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan and Rahmullah Gurbaz, has consistently performed brilliantly in the last few years. The Afghan team, which is in great form, is now ready to make a splash in the Champions Trophy as well.

The Bangladesh team participating in the Champions Trophy is not among the top-8 teams in the ICC ODI rankings. Bangladesh is currently ranked 9th in the ODI rankings and its rating is 81. For some time now, the performance of the Bangladesh team has not been up to expectations. Despite having experienced players like Shakib Al Hasan, Liton Das and Mushfiqur Rahim, the team is lagging behind in important matches.

The competition in the championship flight remains tight, with Canlubang trailing at 279 points, just three points ahead of Manila Southwoods. Cebu Country Club (CCC) and Luisita are tied at 274, while Del Monte is close behind at 273.

With Bacolod set to join the championship flight at its home course on Wednesday, an intense battle among the six clubs is expected.

Aguinaldo and Cebu Country Club have both claimed the overall title while competing in the men’s regular Founders Division.

Bacolod signaled its intent early on Monday, led by Julius Susarno’s 58 points. The four-point performance served as a clear warning that another similar effort from any of the players would push the club up to the championship division.

However, that’s the least of Bacolod’s worries, as the club appears determined to go all the way.

Armando Eso spearheaded Bacolod’s charge with 50 points, receiving strong support from Calixto de Leon and Woo Sung Seo, who carded 47 and 44, respectively.

While Bacolod made its move, Canlubang and the other contenders were locked in battle at Bacolod Golf Club. Abe Rosal was one of four players to score in the 50s, with his 52 points bolstering Canlubang’s efforts.

With Abraham Avena and Rolly Viray adding 46 and 44, respectively, Canlubang tallied 142, a score bettered by Manila Southwoods and Luisita.

Southwoods collected 144 points from Theody Pascual (51), Don Breganza (48), and Joseph Tambunting (45) to move up to third.

Luisita Golf Club came through with the best team score — 145 points — to climb to a share of fourth place with Cebu Country Club.

Jingy Tuason led Luisita with 50 points followed by Ferdie Barbosa and Marty Ilagan with 49 and 46, respectively.

CCC settled for 138 points through Jay Yuvallos (48), Eric Deen (47), and On Kyu Ok 43.

"O’Sullivan was riding Wee Charlie for Gerard O’Leary last Thursday and was one of three fallers at the final fence in the two-mile Racing Again February 20th Handicap Chase, with two other runners badly hampered and unseating their riders.

The rest of the meeting was abandoned after the second race as the air ambulance arrived to take O’Sullivan to hospital, and it was later confirmed that he was being treated in the intensive care unit at Cork University Hospital.

He remains there and a Tuesday morning update on X from Dr Jennifer Pugh, chief medical officer of the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, said: “Michael continues to receive the best of care in the intensive care unit at Cork University Hospital.

“Michael’s family remain overwhelmed by the support and well wishes they have received over the last number of days.”

O’Sullivan shot to prominence in 2023 when winning the Supreme Novices’ Hurdle at Cheltenham aboard Marine Nationale, after also tasting Grade One glory with Barry Connell’s charge at Fairyhouse.

"Cells, especially immune cells, need oxygen to function, but too little or too much can be harmful. The chair group of Cell biology and immunology of Wageningen University & Research will investigate the role of oxygen carriers in the immune response. ""Our SPICE project, short for super-charged immune cells, will study the role of special oxygen carriers in the cell: perfluorocarbons. We will test if these particles can support cells with low-oxygen environments, like tumours or areas with infections"", explains professor Mangala Srinivas. The SPICE project is supported by a NWO-M grant.

Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are developed as artificial oxygen carriers in clinical settings. In the last decade, nanoparticles were designed incorporating PFCs, originally as a stable agent for MRI-based in-vivo cell tracking. Researchers at the chair group of Cell biology and immunology (CBI) want to investigate if these PFC-rich imaging agents can create internally oxygen-supplemented cells (IOSCs). For this research, the chair group applied for and was awarded an NWO-M grant. With the M-grants, the Dutch NOW board supports innovative, high-quality, fundamental research and/or studies involving matters of scientific urgency.

""Our ultimate goal is to create super-charged immune cells (SPICE) that can improve treatments for various health conditions"", states Srinivas. IOSCs could, according to the WUR professor, potentially carry oxygen to oxygen-deprived environments, such as solid tumours, sites of arthritis, or drug-resistant bacterial biofilms, all the while avoiding the harmful production of reactive oxygen species. ""However, there is a substantial knowledge gap when it comes to safely loading cells with adequate oxygen and maintaining their oxygen levels long enough to make a meaningful impact.""

The CBI research aims to study and enhance the performance of immune cells loaded with oxygen-rich PFC NPs in low-oxygen environments. The researcher will employ techniques commonly used in other research domains, such as respirometry, cell-based assays, 3D cell culture, soft X-ray tomography, and imaging, along with standard assays to measure intracellular hypoxia-inducible factor levels (HIFs) in immune IOSCs. ""We will assess how these oxygen-loaded immune cells behave in a 3D migration model, and with tumour spheroids. Our overarching goal is to investigate the effects of oxygen loading to generate highly efficient immune cells, which we term 'super-charged immune cells' or 'SPICE'.""

According to Srinivas, SPICE has the potential to provide groundbreaking insights into the impact of intracellular oxygen and its role in modulating the immune response. ""The implications of this research extend beyond cancer, encompassing areas including stem cell transplants, reperfusion therapies, and combating infections - areas that suffer from hypoxia in vivo."" The SPICE project started on February 1 and will run for four years. First results of the research is expected in the course of 2025.",2025-02-11T12:12:15+00:00,https://www.miragenews.com/research-into-super-charged-immune-cells-kicks-1406295/,2b8b2909dc3b4414859b1ff3ca0292f3
"CHIEF Joop Berkhout, the legendary publisher of Spectrum Books and later Safari Books, passed on to eternity at about noon on Monday, February 10, at his home in Ibadan, Oyo State, where he has lived for almost six decades since coming to Nigeria. He was 94.

Born in Amsterdam on March 31 1930, he naturalised as a Nigerian, and was installed as the Okunborode of Ile-Ife, in 1992 while also holding the nationa merit awad of “Officer of the Order of Nigeria”, OON, conferred on him by the Federal government of Nigeria.

Regarded as the doyen of the publishing industry in Nigeria, Chief Berkhout relocated to Africa in the 50s after the Second World War which ravaged his family home in Holland, and destroyed his father’s hotel business. He joined the book trade, working in Tanzania as a bookseller, from where Oxford University Press UK, where he trained originally, headhunted him to be their manager in Lusaka Zambia. As he recalled in an interview:

“I was a war victim. I finished my secondary education. I didn’t go for higher education. I started working. Many of the young generation left the Netherlands, they went to Africa, Australia and some other countries. Some of my family (members) lived in Australia, some lived in Zimbabwe, some lived in South Africa and I decided to go to Tanzania. From Tanzania, I went to Zambia and from Zambia, I came to Nigeria.

“First I worked for a bookshop. With the news of my achievements in bookselling in Tanzania, Oxford University Press where I did my initial training, contacted me about the possibility of being their manager in Lusaka, Zambia. I accepted their offer and left Tanzania for Zambia. My time in Tanzania was historic as I gave birth to three of my children in that country. I served as the Manager of Oxford University Press, Zambia from 1964 to 1966 before I got a letter of transfer to Nigeria as Manager.

“On the evening of the day I got a letter of transfer to Nigeria from Oxford, another letter came from Evans Brothers Publishers offering me a contract job as the pioneer General Manager of their company in Nigeria. Evans was headquartered in the UK but they had a booming interest in Nigeria and needed someone who could help them consolidate and expand their market in Nigeria. When I got home, I discussed the letters with my wife and we opted for Evans Brothers’ offer that had more incentives. I then joined Evans in Nigeria in 1966. After 10 years of working with Evans, I was promoted to be the Marketing Director of Evans UK. That meant I was to relocate to the UK. I did initially but because I didn’t fancy the working environment there, I decided to resign and come back to Nigeria to co-found Spectrum Books Limited in 1978. From a humble beginning, I piloted the affairs of Spectrums Book Limited to making it a major force in the publishing industry today.

“In 2008, at the age of 78 and after 30 years in charge, I felt the need to retire, so I sold Spectrum Books Limited with Soladayo Ogunniyi, whom I brought into the world of publishing during my Evans days. My intention was to enjoy retirement life but only two weeks into retirement, it felt uneasy. I therefore reactivated Safari Books Limited which I had registered in August 1991. Twelve years after the reactivation of Safari Books, I am still in charge of its operations which include book publishing, books/journal supply and sale of e-resources to tertiary institutions.”

He was an adherent promoter of educational publishing, and biographies, which. he said are important sources of understanding society through the stories of leaders in social, political and economic circuits. For merritorious service to the book trade in Nigeria, the federal government conferred the national honour, “Officer of the Order of the Niger” OON, on him.

On the occasion of his 90th birthday anniversary in 2020, the poet laureate, Niyi Osundare and Distinguished Professor of the University of New Orleans (UNO), where he teaches in the English Department. celebrated him in a poem titled “For Joop Berkhout” (The Brave Bookman at 90), the text of which is reproduced below:

You have crossed many oceans

And nested your eggs in trees

Too tall for the breaking wind

In them were ideas which unchain the mind,

Wisdom which tames the terror of hidden things

In the universe of your being

Your Northern needle being so steady

You have never lost your way around the Light

From the hilly heights of Tanganyika

To the copper plains of Zambia

Europe-born, you dug your feet deep into the Nigerian soil

From Evans Brothers to Sunshine House to Safari Fare

The Book remains the priest of your passion

The temple of your trust where the altar

Glows from the lyric of a thousand lamps

From that busy haven in Kingston upon Thames

To Cambridge-Okigbo House in Ibadan, the world’s best books

By your ageless energy, your relentless enterprise

Wherever your feet have touched the ground

A city of Light has risen and bloomed

A Self-effacing man, Chief Berkhout, who rarely granted interviews even as he made significant contributions to the Nigeria’s publishing ecosystem, training many publishers who are today major players in the trade, spoke to Punch newspaper in April 2020, where he touched on his private life, philosophy and delved into the history and trajectory of Nigeria’s publishing industry. The interview, originally captioned “I don’t believe heaven, hell exist — Berkhout, 90-year-old Dutchman who has spent 54 years in Nigeria”, remains evergreen even today, and is reproduced below:

To develop, Nigeria must educate its young ones, manage its population

Chairman, Safari Books Limited, Chief Joop Berkhout, OON, a 90-year-old Dutchman, who has lived in Nigeria for 54 years, shares his life experiences in Holland and Nigeria with SIMON UTEBOR of Punch newspaper)

YOU are a Dutchman who has lived in Ibadan, Oyo State for 54 years, how was your upbringing?

I was born on Monday, March 31, 1930 in Amsterdam, Holland. I am the last child of my parents who were devout Catholics. When I was four years old, my parents relocated from Amsterdam to IJmuiden. The relocation became inevitable due to my father’s dwindling hotel business and the great depression of the 1930s which significantly affected what was left of the business in Amsterdam.

I was educated at St. Lucia Primary School, Haarlem from 1937 to 1943 and proceeded to St. Jeroen Secondary School, also in Haarlem, for my secondary education from 1943 to 1948. The latter part of my primary education and the early parts of my secondary education coincided with the Second World War (September 1, 1939 to September 2, 1945). Although the war did not get to our door in Holland until I was 10 years old, it had adverse effects on my family. Holland shares borders with Germany, one of the leading sides in the Second World War, and at a certain stage, German forces occupied Dutch territory.

As a child then, what was your experience?

I remember that to avoid being hit, my mother instructed us that anytime we heard the sound of a plane, we were to take cover in the kitchen and lie on the floor until the coast was clear. Due to incessant impacts, some of the window frames of our house were shattered and we had to bind them together while also blackening them to avoid being targeted and bombed. Hunger and privation set in on us during the war. Since people could not go to work to earn income, economic activities became very minimal and goods were sold at a high price. As a result, meals had to be rationed between members of my family. I could recollect my siblings and I back then holding our buckets, waiting to collect our portion of soup.

Few occasional respites came from humanitarian agencies that flew planes across our territory. As they flew across, they would drop loaves of bread and every one of us would scamper to get as many as possible and keep them secure, only to be brought out for gradual consumption.

Did the war affect your higher education?

I was a war victim. I finished my secondary education. I didn’t go for higher education. I started working. Many of the young generation left the Netherlands, they went to Africa, Australia and some other countries. Some of my families lived in Australia, some lived in Zimbabwe, some lived in South Africa and I decided to go to Tanzania. From Tanzania, I went to Zambia and from Zambia, I came to Nigeria.

How many African countries have you been to?

I have visited many African countries. I like visiting and I love Africa. I worked in Tanzania, I worked in Kenya and I worked in Zambia. I worked in Malawi before I came here (Nigeria).

In those places you worked in Africa, what did you observe?

The world is one place. First I worked for a bookshop. With the news of my achievements in book selling in Tanzania, Oxford University Press where I did my initial training, contacted me about the possibility of being their manager in Lusaka, Zambia. I accepted their offer and left Tanzania for Zambia. My time in Tanzania was historic as I gave birth to three of my children in that country. I served as the Manager of Oxford University Press, Zambia from 1964 to 1966 before I got a letter of transfer to Nigeria as Manager.

On the evening of the day I got a letter of transfer to Nigeria from Oxford, another letter came from Evans Brothers Publishers offering me a contract job as the pioneer General Manager of their company in Nigeria. Evans was headquartered in the UK but they had a booming interest in Nigeria and needed someone who could help them consolidate and expand their market in Nigeria. When I got home, I discussed the letters with my wife and we opted for Evans Brothers’ offer that had more incentives. I then joined Evans in Nigeria in 1966. After 10 years of working with Evans, I was promoted to be the Marketing Director of Evans UK. That meant I was to relocate to the UK. I did initially but because I didn’t fancy the working environment there, I decided to resign and come back to Nigeria to co-found Spectrum Books Limited in 1978. From a humble beginning, I piloted the affairs of Spectrums Book Limited to making it a major force in the publishing industry today.

In 2008, at the age of 78 and after 30 years in charge, I felt the need to retire, so I sold Spectrum Books Limited with Soladayo Ogunniyi, whom I brought into the world of publishing during my Evans days. My intention was to enjoy retirement life but only two weeks into retirement, it felt uneasy. I therefore reactivated Safari Books Limited which I had registered in August 1991. Twelve years after the reactivation of Safari Books, I am still in charge of its operations which include book publishing, books/journal supply and sale of e-resources to tertiary institutions.

How do you perceive Nigeria having lived here for 54 years?

Nigeria is a country with milk and honey, a country with enormous possibilities and a great future. Although I must say in 1966 when I came here, everything was working, and of course we only had 40 million people. Now we are suffering from population explosion and we have about 200 million people and I believe we don’t know what to do with it.

You said Nigeria is a country that flows with milk and honey, yet we have a serious unemployment problem, how do you reconcile it with your statement?

It is because the country is suffering from overpopulation. In terms of work, if you have 10 people qualified and you can employ only two, you have a problem. In a company, if you employ more people that you need, you have a problem.

What would be your advice in this regard?

Now a lot of young people are starting business of their own; Internet and telecommunications have made young people to come out but in the crisis which we are in now, we don’t have enough doctors. This is not only happening in Nigeria, all over the world, we don’t have enough doctors to deal with coronavirus. They have recalled all retired doctors in the United Kingdom. Life is problematic in itself. As for me, for everybody, your life is in your own hands. Unfortunately, a lot of people don’t enjoy their jobs, not only in Nigeria, it is happening in many countries in the world. Lots of people work because they need money but they don’t enjoy what they are doing. I always tell people, if you don’t enjoy it, don’t do it for long, do something with your life. People must enjoy what they are doing.

You have been in Nigeria for many years; apart from overpopulation, what other issues have you observed here?

I think the standard of education is not at the same level as it used to be in 1966. Education is an international thing; you can’t isolate your education to Nigeria alone. Anywhere in the world, universities have staff members from all over the world. All the universities – Oxford, Cambridge or King’s College in London, where my son is a professor, the staff and students are from all over the world. The teaching staff in Ibadan comprised people from England, Holland, and so on. If you localise things, you put yourself in the box and restrict yourself. Look at the medical education, many of the Nigerian professors in the medical world are successful in the UK and the US. But here, education is restricted, the medicine is not available and there is no electricity. The medical director in Ibadan said he runs the hospital with 75 generators; you can’t do any surgery at the moment in any hospital because the power supply can go at any moment; it is an issue. The schools have become a bit too localised. If you now appoint a person based on their religion, colour or ethnicity, you are asking for trouble.

In Nigeria we have the federal character system; don’t you think that is normal?

I don’t believe in federal character system. You must get the best for the job. Where a person comes from does not matter, what matters is does the person qualify for the job, does he have the relevant experience. But here they say, where do you come from, and it is not about the qualifications and experience.

Do you think it is one of the problems affecting the country?

Yes, it could be because people are being appointed to certain jobs, especially in the civil service who should not be appointed because they are not qualified and educated for the job. You can’t say they come from my hometown, then they must be appointed; take the best available. There must be competition and the best should get the job irrespective of where they come from.

You talk about overpopulation, if you were to advise the government, what would your advice be about the population issue in the country?

They are to make the best use of the population. In China and India (for India, it was done at the state level) years ago, they reduced number of children per family to two. They controlled that but here, some ethnic groups won’t allow it because they think a child is a blessing. But when you create a child, you must understand that the child is your responsibility until they are at least 20 years old. A lot of parents are not good parents because they are all working, so the children are being brought up by illiterate nannies and illiterate home helps. Sometimes people come home around 10pm and they leave the house again by 4am the following day, and they never see their children perhaps until weekend. But on weekends, they may go to a party or funeral, so the family values have collapsed or they have no time to look after their children. To me, those parents should not have children. If you have a child, you should be fully responsible. When I came here, we did not have this problem but now everybody wants to work. My wife never worked, she looked after the children. We did not have any home help to look after the children. As a parent, you are responsible to educate the children.

Speaking of population growth, countries like China and India with a lot more people, for instance, are doing better despite their large populations, why is Nigeria’s case different?

They are big countries with big industries and large exports. If you have a big population, and you must have big infrastructure, lands, openings, education, universities, etc., you have no problem. But if you have a large population and there is no market for this population, you have a problem. Every parent is responsible for the creation of a child and all they think about is that it is God’s gift. It has nothing to do with God, it is your own making to have that child.

You have brought out the issue of religion. How do you see the religious practices in Nigeria?

It could be dangerous. Not all, but all these new religions. Religion has become a business. Everybody is a pastor; there are more pastors in this country than anywhere in the world. Pastors who are not even educated are preaching and making a lot of money. Religion is now a money-making affair.

What is your advice?

It is beyond me, I can’t advise. Karl Marx said “religion is opium for the people”. And to a certain extent, that is true. Life is very easy as far as I am concerned and it is all in your own hands. If something goes wrong, don’t blame anybody, you look at yourself first and what you have done. You may be responsible. Like if you drive a car and you have an accident, you can find out if it is you (that should be blamed) or the person who hit you. But you always try to blame somebody else or society, but you should look at what have you done. But to me, life is wonderful. A lot of people look forward to turning 60, 65 and so on. I am 90 and I stay in my office every day or travel with my family. But the most damaging thing or killing thing is if you get up in the morning and don’t know what to do for the day.

What is your faith?

I haven’t got any faith. I am an unbeliever. I used to have faith, I was a Catholic. I was born into a Catholic family. My leaving Catholicism was beyond me. It was my parents who were Catholics and they baptised me and they brought me over to Catholic. When you grow older, you look at things differently, you look for their opinions but I don’t think faith or religion will help anybody.

But some people will tell you that there is a need to serve God, the Supreme Being?

Well, that is part of faith; it all depends on what you believe in. If you are dead, you are dead. You came from nowhere and you go nowhere.

Are you saying that when people die, that is the end?

Many people believe that when people die, they either go to hell or heaven, what do you think about that?

Oh, it does not exist, forget about it. You better don’t believe it. In my opinion, hell or heaven does not exist. You need to find out. When you find out, you should know better.

The Bible and the Qur’an teach so…

Things are changing. Things in the old days are not anymore applicable today. The world is changing.

In your mini biography, one of your ambitions was to become a Pope, how did that change?

I was brought up by the Catholic and I thought it would be… I am an ambitious person. So when I was young, I thought if I became a priest, that would be nice. I wanted to become a priest and then go on to become a Pope as a young boy. I tried it for a couple of months but realised I just would never become a Pope. However, I got discouraged from pursuing that course after I was told that there was once a Pope of Dutch origin in the 13th century who was assassinated only after three months into his papacy. With that information, I formed an opinion that there was a conspiracy against Dutch from being popes. So I abandoned the ambition. Now I am a publisher.

How is book publishing in this country?

Oh, tremendous! People need books, people need to be educated, people need to read and the world is changing. Every day, something new is coming up. Look at the Internet. Today, there is coronavirus, the whole world is very exciting, far more exciting than ever before.

How do you perceive education generally?

It is the most important sector in any society. You must educate. Education is a lifelong experience. I learn something every day. If I retire in the evening and I haven’t done any reading that day, I have wasted my time. I read at least two books a month. You must read to acquire skills and knowledge. As an individual, you can’t know everything but you must continue to learn; the world is changing every day. Everything is changing so you must keep up to date. I try every day at my age of 90 to keep up to date with the latest developments. I can sit down and say I am 90, what am I doing with this or that? But no, I am still relatively in good health. I enjoy what I am doing, I enjoy Nigeria, I enjoy going around. To me, life is a very personal thing and whether you make or don’t make it is all in your own hands.

When did you marry and how did you meet your wife?

I married in Holland. My wife has passed on. She died of cancer. I have four children, three are in the UK and one is in Nigeria. The one in Nigeria is working as an architect in Lagos. My eldest son is 59, my second child is 57 and one is 55. My eldest son is a professor, my daughter is a teacher and the other boy works for himself.

How do you feel about your decision to come to Nigeria?

I am very pleased that I was able to come to Nigeria and I am very pleased that I am still here.

Are you worried about the security challenges in Nigeria?

Of course, I am worried. Everybody should be worried. You have to be careful while going out. In the old days, you could drive all over Nigeria, even during the civil war. It was not as dangerous as it is now. The North is very dangerous. I was in Kaduna few weeks ago for a book launch. I flew into Kaduna airport, met with the government and felt safe. But this has to do with unemployment, poverty, among others. There is something I find curious. Some people said coronavirus would not get to Nigeria because we pray. Religion to me could be damaging and very negative to the reality because if you are over religious, you lose your reason of thinking.

What is the secret of your longevity?

I enjoy what I am doing. I can’t do anything I don’t like. Whatever I do, I put my best in it. You can only succeed in life through enjoying it (what you do) and making your contribution. It is all in your hands, don’t blame anybody else, but yourself.

What food do you enjoy most?

I don’t eat much anymore. I don’t like spicy food. I like edikaikong soup; it is not spicy. I like Lebanese and French foods. Food is no more an issue for me. I just eat because one has to eat but when I go to parties, I enjoy good meals but small portions.

What kind of music do you enjoy?

I enjoy classical music. I like Fela Anikulapo-Kuti music and others. I also like church music; Catholic Church music.

You have been staying in Ibadan for a long time, how would you describe your stay there?

Ibadan was nice, clean and peaceful when we came in. When we came with my young children here, you could drive day and night without any issue. Ibadan was an interesting place because every November, we would hold an interesting party. Many people came to Ibadan to celebrate. To be honest, I enjoyed Nigeria of that time: everything was near perfect, if not perfect. There was stable electricity and if there was going to be an outage, there was an announcement on the radio and in the newspapers to that effect with a date and time of restoration.

At my house, we got fresh milk daily from a farm at Apata in Ibadan. The standard of education was also very good and comparable to what obtained elsewhere. My children were schooled at the All Saints School and International School, both in Ibadan. Nobody bothered to build high-rise fences because cases of burglary and theft were minimal. I went everywhere mostly alone in the car and had no cause to worry. But then, Nigeria at that time had just about 40 million people.",2025-02-11T12:16:56+00:00,https://ntm.ng/2025/02/11/joop-berkhout-the-publishing-giant-steps-on/,e8b8814cf3bc4a348156bf856901d7e5
"Today we are celebrating remarkable women, nominated by the BirdLife Partnership in recognition of their leadership, dedication and passion for conserving nature. The path they have chosen has been challenging, often working in male-dominated environments and cultures. Yet, the empowerment of women and girls in science is vital to combat the biodiversity and climate crisis. As described by UN Women, the climate crisis is not ‘gender neutral’: women are and will be disproportionately impacted if we don’t stop the escalation of the crises. The reality is that science needs women, as much as women need science. We need a diversity of voices, experiences and backgrounds to create the innovative, sustainable solutions that will ensure a world where all life can thrive. These are stories of women across the BirdLife Partnership who have led the way to ensure that female voices and perspectives are firmly entrenched in the conservation of nature. “As the Project Manager for the Islands Restoration Programme in the Pacific, I work closely with regional partners to implement impactful biodiversity initiatives, with a focus on invasive species management. This crucial work is designed to restore and enhance ecosystem resilience in island environments, not only to protect native bird species and biodiversity, but also to promote the social and environmental well-being of local communities and indigenous peoples. My passion for pursuing a career in science was sparked by my deep connection to nature and my curiosity as a child. Growing up, I loved spending time in my village, where I was always surrounded by forests, plantations and freshwater streams. This fuelled my desire to pursue a path where I could understand how people interact with the environment. It wasn’t until I joined BirdLife International almost 20 years ago that I found my passion for birds and biodiversity. The opportunity to work in BirdLife with like-minded professionals has been incredibly fulfilling. My dedication to the work that I do continues to grow as I understand the threats to our birds and biodiversity, and I can witness the positive impacts of our work on both the environment and communities. As a woman in science, I’ve encountered both challenges and opportunities that have shaped the way I work in this space. I’ve learned to embrace resilience and foster collaboration, particularly within local communities. With the growing recognition of diversity in science and the increasing support for women doing conservation and environmental work, I would encourage young women, particularly Pacific women to pursue their passions in science and conservation. Science is for everyone, regardless of gender. And follow your curiosity, if you’re curious about how things work or why things happen, pursue that interest. Curiosity is the foundation of discovery!” Science is for everyone, regardless of gender. And follow your curiosity, if you’re curious about how things work or why things happen, pursue that interest.

Khaing Swe War is the Biodiversity Conservation Officer for Biodiversity and Nature Conservation Association, our Partner in Myanmar, Women excel just as much as men in some conservation activities, so don’t give up just because you’re a girl! – Khaing Swe War “When we were young, the internet was not as widespread as it is today. There was a TV channel that aired a weekly program called ‘Discovery‘, which focused on wildlife ecology. It inspired me to start thinking about how we could save wildlife and what kind of conservation efforts could be implemented. Our country is developing, and in many such countries, careers in conservation are often perceived as male-dominated – particularly in fields requiring physical fieldwork. I’ve always been confident in my gender. However, due to the perceptions of women in our country, there are some areas where it is difficult for women to be involved, such as in matters related to communication. In an environment where many people lack awareness of conservation, women may not view it as a viable career path simply because it is not widely recognised or prioritised. However, this perception is gradually changing. As awareness of conservation issues increases, more opportunities may arise for both women and men to pursue careers in this field, and women’s involvement may continue to grow. Now I have the opportunity to learn about conservation and related work. I share this knowledge with the younger generation in my community. Additionally, working on project sites allows me to observe and research wildlife species up close, which has become a source of great pride for me. I believe that sharing inspiring stories of women in conservation is really important to motivate them to sign up for youth clubs, workshops, or summer camps that focus on environmental awareness. Encouraging them to start small environmental projects, such as a school garden, bird-watching activity, tree planting, or trash clean-ups, is also another great way in. Women excel just as much as men in some conservation activities, so don’t give up just because you’re a girl!”

“For more than 25 years I have been researching the biology and ecology of birds. My main motivation to pursue a scientific career is my family and the privilege of being surrounded by nature. I coordinate several conservation and environmental education initiatives, from the Important Bird and Biodiversity Conservation Areas Programme to leading the group ‘Women as Agents of Change’. An initiative called ‘Wings of Rice’ has enabled me to establish a relationship between farmers and the conservation of biodiversity associated with rice fields as artificial wetlands. Furthermore, I developed the green seal “Bird-friendly rice” that allowed us from the Calidris Association to recognise, value and show the work of farming communities that cultivate in a sustainable way. As a woman in science, I have faced several challenges in a country where female scientists are rarely heard and considered in decision-making spaces. However, these challenges have allowed me to value my role as a woman and promote this empowerment with women who conduct science from home and are often invisible. My experience of working as a woman of science began in my undergraduate studies when I applied to become an environmental educator and museum guide. I realized that I had to create spaces for girls and young people to participate without feeling ashamed to expose their knowledge. Although more than 20 years have passed since I started my work experience, every day I continue to learn; now we talk about equity and equality associated with gender and women’s empowerment. This is the beauty of being a woman of science; we are always open to learning. As a woman in science, I can say that being a scientist is something that fills the heart and soul; it enriches you as a person. We awaken a deep connection that goes beyond the tangible. If a woman wants to be a scientist, I can only tell her: “Go ahead, it is worth it, you will discover many things, and you will have the privilege of seeing life in a different way, in an almost magical way’. “ Yanira Cifuentes is a Biologist for our Partner in Colombia Asociación Calidris. I can say that being a scientist is something that fills the heart and soul; it enriches you as a person. – Yanira Cifuentes

Wildlife was always a big part of Lucy Haskell’s life growing up. I was initially drawn to fieldwork, but finding opportunities to gain field experience while staying safe was not easy. – Lucy Haskell “My work at BirdLife focuses on synthesising and communicating the Partnership’s science to a range of audiences, such as decision-makers and conservation practitioners. I lead the development of the State of the World’s Birds report and manage the BirdLife DataZone website, as well as providing technical expertise in support of the wider Science Division. Growing up in the British countryside, wildlife was always a big part of my life. I spent countless hours at the local nature reserve, learning from other birdwatchers and eventually becoming a volunteer. At school, I quickly discovered that I was no good at languages, history or geography (and let’s not even mention sports!), but I had a natural aptitude for science and maths. So, when the time came to choose a career path, conservation science seemed an obvious choice. I soon learned that being a woman pursuing a career in science came with its own set of challenges. I was initially drawn to fieldwork, but finding opportunities to gain field experience while staying safe was not easy. I often found myself working alone or with men I had only just met in remote locations, and had to continually push myself outside of my comfort zone. I found I had to make more of an effort to make my voice heard than my male counterparts, experienced sexist comments, and to this day I struggle with imposter syndrome. But despite these struggles, I persevered. I eventually found a job where I could put my skills to use whilst feeling safe, heard and respected. My advice to any girls thinking of pursuing a career in science would be don’t give up! It won’t always be easy, but remember that you have just as much right to do this as anyone else, and don’t be afraid to advocate for yourself and others.“",2025-02-11T12:07:11+00:00,https://www.birdlife.org/news/2025/02/11/celebrating-the-remarkable-women-within-the-birdlife-partnership-part-2/,4d882ffe467b4409bbc876afa1205cea
"Lahore, February 11: The Career Services Office (CSO) at LUMS recently hosted its Annual Career Fair, a flagship event that bridges the gap between academia and industry by connecting LUMS students with leading employers. This year’s fair brought together more than 200 renowned national and international companies who engaged with over 1,800 students and alumni from various disciplines. Through on-site interviews, detailed career guidance, and resume submissions, the event gave students exposure to hiring practices and career pathways, ensuring they are well-prepared for an evolving job market.

 LUMS has maintained its position as the top university in Pakistan for graduate employability, with 95% of its 2024 graduates securing employment within nine months—a testament to its strong industry linkages and career-focused initiatives. Additionally, LUMS’ impressive rise of over 100 positions in the QS World University Ranking in 2024, placing it among the top 36% of universities globally, underscores its commitment to producing world-class talent.

 Considering Pakistan’s growing economic challenges, retaining this top talent within the country is becoming increasingly critical. Events like the LUMS Career Fair play a crucial role in linking students with promising local career opportunities, encouraging them to contribute to Pakistan’s economic growth and innovation.

"A charity cycling event is set to return with record participation as business leaders take on a gruelling two-day challenge to support seafaring families.

The annual Bridge2Bridge ride, previously led by John Good Group chief executive Adam Walsh, will now be organised by the Sailors’ Children’s Society, which raised £20,000 through the event in 2024.

The 212-mile ride from the Severn Bridge to the Humber Bridge takes place over the weekend of 13-14 September, with 30 cyclists expected to take part.

Adam, who will still captain the team for this year’s ride, said: “We want to make the Bridge2Bridge ride bigger, with more riders helping us to hit higher fundraising targets, and the best way to do that is for the Society, as a nationwide charity, to take the lead in activating its network of supporters and to organise their involvement.

“I’ll still be there to lead the team and promoting the Bridge2Bridge ride and the benefits it brings to the charity and the participants.

“But the rewards of the training and completing the event itself, at a personal level, make it all worthwhile.

“The feeling you get when the Humber Bridge comes into view needs to be experienced.”

Natasha Barley, chief executive of the Sailors’ Children’s Society, added: “We are so grateful to Adam and to John Good Group.

“Adam completed the incredible feat of covering the 212 miles in a solo ride in just one day in 2023.

“With logistical support from his business and others, he assembled a team of eight for the two-day trip last year and now we’re aiming for 30 riders.

“That’s a game-changer in terms of organisation so the Society is putting in more effort to enable Adam to concentrate on leading the riders.

“Last year we had a mix of experience and ability – including a novice who had never cycled long distances – and they all finished the ride in style.”

Participants must raise at least £1,500 each, with all proceeds supporting disadvantaged children from maritime backgrounds.

"In Scotland, undergraduate tuition is free for the majority of Scottish students, with the funding for universities coming from the Scottish Government, research grants from the private sector, and fees charged on students from overseas.

However, the Scottish Funding Council sets a cap on the number of funded places for Scottish students.
• Scottish universities: funding, fees and the future - read every article in The Herald's landmark series
• Scottish Labour to keep child payment and baby box
• MSP responds to claim AI was used to submit 1,000 questions

Last year, figures revealed that the number of home students studying at Scotland's universities fell by almost 10,000.

There were a total of 173,745 enrolments from Scottish students in 2022/23, down from 183,025 in 2021/22.

Scots made up 59% of students at Scottish universities in 2022/23, with international students at 29% and English students at 10%.

At the time, Professor Steve Decent, Principal and Vice-Chancellor at Glasgow Caledonian University, warned that students from the poorest backgrounds were being ""most disadvantaged"" by the limit.

In England, there is no cap on domestic students but most will pay fees, which will rise to £9,535 this year.

In his letter, Mr Sarwar said his party was ""committed to ensuring that Scottish students, of all backgrounds, are able to access university.""

He added: ""We must create a funding settlement that both protects our world-leading universities but also gives any Scottish student who wants to pursue the university route, the opportunity and support to do so.""

Mr Sarwar said he and his Education Spokesperson, Pam Duncan-Glancy, were committed to working with the sector to ""explore options for reforming higher education to ensure that Scotland can continue to have a vibrant university sector.""

He added: ""Should Scottish Labour be fortunate enough to lead the next Scottish Government, we will ensure that Scotland’s universities are at the heart of our plans to drive economic growth and to expand opportunity for all.

""A Scottish Labour government would also partner with colleges and businesses to ensure that every young Scot gets the opportunities that they need to succeed regardless of the route they

 take.""
• Mapped: University tuitions fees across the UK and Europe
• How can universities meet the global challenges of the future?

The SNP's Karen Adam accused Mr Sarwar of “hypocrisy on stilts.”

The MSP said: “History has shown that his Labour Party cannot be trusted on tuition fees.

“Whether in Scotland, England or Wales — fees have gone up under Labour governments.

“It increasingly looks like Anas Sarwar will say anything — and adopt SNP policies — in his desperate attempt to get into power. But why should voters trust him on tuition fees after broken promises on winter fuel payments, compensation for Waspi women and the future of Grangemouth?

“Under the SNP, we have record numbers of Scottish students securing places at our universities, and recent figures showed a rise in students from our most disadvantaged communities.

“This progress has only been made possible because the SNP abolished Labour’s tuition fees and we will never let them be reimposed on Scotland’s students.”

In 2020, Sir Keir Starmer campaigned for the Labour leadership in 2020 saying he would ""support the abolition of tuition fees.""

"UST’s Gula, Perdido ruled out for the season

UNIVERSITY of Santo Tomas’ (UST) redemption tour in the UAAP Season 87 women’s volleyball tournament just took another massive hit.

Wing spiker Xyza Gula has been ruled out for the rest of the season due to back injury according to Santo Tomas’ statement days before the anticipated opener on Saturday.

Ms. Gula suffered a tailbone fracture after a bad fall during practice as Santo Tomas braces for revenge after a runner-up finish to National University (NU) in Season 86.

“With this, it has been decided that she will not be in the UST lineup for the upcoming season because her health and future as an athlete are far more important than our campaign,” the Golden Tigresses stated.

Ms. Gula’s injury came on the heels of opposite hitter Jonna Perdido’s anterior cruciate ligament injury last month that will definitely take a toll on Santo Tomas’ campaign as one of the title contenders.

The duo provided solid coverage to ace player and Rookie of the Year Angge Poyos in Santo Tomas’ stellar run last year after finishing as the second seed behind the mighty NU.

The Golden Tigresses would absorb a 0-2 sweep against the Lady Bulldogs in the finale but gained a much-needed experience for their planned redemption this year.

Without Mses. Gula and Perdido, massive responsibility will be on the hands of Ms. Poyos, the UAAP’s Second Best Outside Spiker, as well as team captain and reigning Best Libero Detdet Pepito.

Santo Tomas along with NU, De La Salle University, Far Eastern University, Ateneo de Manila University, University of the East, Adamson University and host University of the Philippines will have their first faceoff on Thursday in the UAAP’s pre-season press conference at the Mall of Asia Arena.

"Head of the Metropolitan Police Sir Mark Rowley said it is “absurd” that officers who are not fit to hold vetting cannot be lawfully sacked.

Sergeant Lino Di Maria successfully mounted a legal challenge, supported by the Metropolitan Police Federation, after having his vetting removed over sexual assault allegations, which he denies.

He was found to have no case to answer in respect of misconduct allegations, and argued that having his vetting removed without the accusations being proved is a breach of his right to a fair trial.

Sir Mark said: “Today’s ruling on the law has left policing in a hopeless position.

“We now have no mechanism to rid the Met of officers who were not fit to hold vetting – those who cannot be trusted to work with women, or those who cannot be trusted to enter the homes of vulnerable people.

“It is absolutely absurd that we cannot lawfully sack them.

“This would not be the case in other sectors where staff have nothing like the powers comparable to police officers.”

He called on the Government to take action to urgently change the rules around officers’ vetting.

Reacting to the ruling on Tuesday by Mrs Justice Lang, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: “This decision has significant implications for the work the Met is now doing to clean up the force, raise standards and rid the police of all those unfit to serve.

“I have long been clear that there can be no hiding place for those who abuse their position of trust and authority within the police.

“Working alongside the Met Commissioner, I want no let-up in the vital work being carried out to raise standards and rebuild public confidence in the Met.

“No-one who has failed vetting should continue to serve in the force and we will work closely with the commissioner, the Home Office and partners to assess the implications of this ruling.”",2025-02-11T12:13:07+00:00,https://www.sthelensstar.co.uk/news/national/24926289.absurd-met-police-cannot-sack-officers-not-fit-hold-vetting---commissioner/,832591f371e0407b85c9f21f987f373f

"Former Syria rebel groups in the southern province of Daraa say they are not against integrating into a unified Syrian army under the control of the transitional government in Damascus, amid reports their leaders want to remain as an independent armed faction.

Nassim Abu Arra, the spokesperson of the 'Southern Operations Room' coalition, issued a statement carried by local outlet on Monday rejecting claims of divisions with Damascus.

He said the people of the south were the first to begin the revolution, were the first to call for the establishment of a new ministry of defence, and its fighters were also the first to enter Damascus during the collapse of the Assad regime.

In his statement, Abu Arra outlined three principles that ""form the foundation of our vision for Syria's future"". The first principle states that the people of southern Syria are a ""symbol for national unity"" and affirms that Daraa will strive for stability and national unity.

The second saw Abu Arra claim that the south would not allow for the revolution to be undermined by internal and external forces and that the southern forces would never act against law and justice in Syria.

""We will build a free and strong Syria, under a system that protects the rights of its people and guarantees fair participation among all its components, based on merit and competence,"" he said.

The coalition's statement comes amid tension between the southern factions and the new transitional authority in Damascus over the former's alleged refusal to dissolve into the new unified army.

On Thursday, Syria's Defence Minister Murhaf Abu Qasra told that the leader of the Eight Brigade, Ahmed al-Awda, had rebuffed attempts by the defence ministry to bring his faction under central control.

Awda had previously reconciled with the Assad regime during an offensive against rebels in Daraa in 2018, coming under Russian patronage and protection.

As the HTS-led rebels launched an offensive against the regime and began moving towards Damascus, Awda launched an uprising against the regime in Daraa and entered the Damascus suburbs from the south.

A leader in the Eighth Brigade also told Arabic language edition that high-level coordination between the southern factions and ministry of defence are taking place.

""The Eighth Brigade is ready to integrate into the ministry of defence, but on condition that it operates within a disciplined military framework without the exclusion of defected officers and revolutionaries,"" the commander said.

In separate comments to affiliate , Suleiman Abul Baqi said that local factions in Suweida had discussed their integration into a central body and that this could happen soon as part of a restructuring of military institutions.

Several Druze-majority militias operated in Syria during the war, outside the direct command of Bashar Al-Assad and sometimes clashing with armed factions linked to the regime.

He also indicated that defected officers from the Syrian army would be reinstated into the new military formation, reflecting a broader effort to unify ranks and reintegrate army personnel who had defected in past years.

Following the toppling of the Assad regime on 8 December, Syria's transitional government has attempted to consolidate its authority by centralising Syria's myriad of rebel groups into a unified army.

In doing so the government established a new ministry of defence in December and in January announced the dissolution of rebel groups into the unified army.",2025-02-11T12:14:34+00:00,https://www.newarab.com/news/south-syrian-groups-signal-readiness-integrate-new-army,c063f02fcc454f228a76c204b71a93a1

"With the January transfer window closed and an extended break since last Monday’s defeat to rivals Sunderland, Middlesbrough return to action on Wednesday evening at Sheffield United where they could really do with a result.

Boro head into the game in poor form, having won only three of their last 13 games. It’s form that won’t be anywhere near good enough to see them earn a play-off place this season, so it has to improve in the final 16 games.

After a busy transfer window with six new arrivals and seven departees, it’s quite a new-look Boro squad to carry forward into the run-in. That new look offers fresh challenges for Carrick as he looks to arrest the slump and meet expectations in this season’s promotion race. Here are Carrick’s four biggest challenges.

Finding the right balance after Ryan Giles’ return

We all know what Ryan Giles is all about from his first spell at the club. He suited Carrick’s preferred playing style, and it’s why the Boro boss has fought so hard to bring him back on multiple occasions prior to last month’s reunion.

However, in a side that has been so defensively vulnerable all season, Giles’ return brings with it a challenge for Carrick in terms of ensuring Boro don’t leave themselves overly exposed by Giles’ attacking exploits. First time around, they did that by having defensively-minded Tommy Smith tuck in to make a relatively solid back three when Boro were in possession. It helped they were a free-scoring attacking force back then too.

While that will no doubt be the expectation again this time around, it’s fair to say Boro aren’t looking as competent defensively right now in comparison to Giles’ original spell. Right-back is a particular issue, with both Luke Ayling and Anfernee Dijksteel more naturally attack-minded full-backs themselves, while Ayling’s form is of real concern right now.

Giles adds a new dimension to Boro’s attack that has been so dearly missing since his exit. He also insists his recent spells at Luton Town and Hull City have improved the defensive side of his game. But Carrick has a challenge to ensure Boro get the best out of Giles without over-exposing themselves. A ‘you score two, we’ll score three’ mentality will be difficult to uphold throughout the rest of the season.

It’s not just Giles who adds to Boro’s new attacking dimensions. In a top-heavy focused January, Boro brought in three new attackers as Morgan Whittaker arrived on a permanent from Plymouth Argyle, while Samuel Iling-Junior and Kelechi Iheanacho arrived on loan. They replaced Isaiah Jones, Emmanuel Latte Lath, Micah Hamilton and Alex Gilbert.

On paper, they’re at the very least like-for-like replacements, and certainly in the case of Whittaker and Iling-Junior, can be considered upgrades. But the big question now is how Carrick knits it together to make it a success. Added to the difficulty is the fact Boro don’t really have time to allow their new attacking players to settle.

Ben Doak’s injury only adds to the pressure, particularly on Whittaker, to make an immediate impact, with Boro in need of results and improved attacking displays after losing their spark in recent weeks. Iling-Junior, given his versatility, admits he doesn’t yet know himself what his best role is, while Iheanacho is a new striker who Boro’s attacking players need to quickly figure out how best to service. The extended training time will have helped all settle and integrate a little more, but blending that together into a winning style, formation and formula is now Carrick’s task.

Limiting injuries, particularly in two areas

While Boro went top heavy and improved their options in January, it is fair to say they ended the January window defensively weaker, despite the frailties this season in that area. Though they managed to seal George Edmundson’s return on a permanent basis, they allowed Matt Clarke to leave without a replacement, meaning it’s in depth rather than quality that they’re weakened.

Not signing a defender was ultimately Carrick’s decision, though there were attempts to add extra steel in midfield amid Aidan Morris recent injury and how that brought into focus his importance. Glen Kamara, Will Smallbone and Tyler Morton are just three of the names we know Boro either tried to sign, or at least enquired about, without success.

In a continuation from last season, Boro have not been able to rectify their poor injury record. Still far too often this season has Carrick been without key players for extended periods - and concerningly, quite a lot of those have been muscle injuries. It’s not been quite as bad as last season, but it’s still been impactful and something Carrick and Boro simply have to get to the bottom of, and fast.

The culmination of the January transfer window and balance of the squad left behind brings attention to the importance of avoiding injuries as much as possible. That’s particularly the case at centre-back and also in midfield, with one fewer senior centre-back in the squad, Jonny Howson struggling all season for fitness and Dan Barlaser still failing to make the grade.

Results by any means necessary

We’ve mentioned a lot the defensive frailties of Boro this season - something highlighted by the fact that Carrick’s side have conceded 39 goals in 30 matches. But Carrick has fairly pointed out previously that actually the stats suggest there are no structural issues.

On average, only Burnley concede fewer shots at their goal per game, while Boro are fifth in the fewest shots on target conceded per game. However, where they fall down defensively is in their shots to goals ratio where a league-high 13% of shots they concede result in goals for the opposition.

That could suggest an issue in goal and indeed Carrick made a swap in December as Seny Dieng lost his place to Sol Brynn, only for both to suffer long-term injuries. In January they added a goalkeeper of Premier League quality in Mark Travers. But even after an impressive debut against Sunderland, he still left the field having conceded three goals.

And those three goals were systemic of Boro this season - with all three coming after they gave away the ball in their own half, leaving themselves open to the quick transition. They are top of league for most goals conceded due to unenforced errors.

While it would be fair to put that, in part, on the players individually as moments in games and lapses in concentration continue to cost Boro, Carrick has to take some responsibility. The reality is, the errors are coming far too often because of the way in which the head coach is insisting his team play.

When it works, it can be devastatingly effective for Boro. But the harsh reality is, it’s not working often enough this season and Boro can be considered one the Championship’s biggest underachievers this season - with that their biggest downfall. This is a results driven business and the onus is therefore on Carrick to arrest the slump and turn Boro’s fortunes around.

Whether it’s in better application of his preferred style, or through finding an alternative way that doesn’t prove so risky, Carrick has to find a way to get results between now and the end of the season. To miss out on top six would be a failure for Boro given the resources, and questions would rightly be asked of him.",2025-02-11T12:18:53+00:00,https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/four-biggest-middlesbrough-problems-michael-30979315,0ef6dd1f0c4e44dc8dc18c2a6391006f

"Approval is based on the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-671 Trial

KIRKLAND, QC , Feb. 11, 2025 /CNW/ — Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada , announced that Health Canada has granted approval for KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, as a treatment for adult patients with resectable Stage II, IIIA, or IIIB (T3-4N2) non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, and then continued as monotherapy as adjuvant treatment after surgery. This approval is based on results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-671 trial, which demonstrated statistically significant results for its dual primary endpoints of event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) versus neoadjuvant placebo plus chemotherapy followed by adjuvant placebo alone.

“While we have made significant advancements for patients with advanced lung cancer, it remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Canada . This underscores the importance of addressing lung cancer cases in earlier stages, to help improve patient outcomes,” stated Dr. Jonathan Spicer, thoracic surgeon and scientist at the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC), Scientist in the Cancer Research Program at The Institute, Professor of Surgery at McGill University , and Medical Director of the McGill Thoracic Oncology Network. “This recent approval adds another therapeutic option for patients with operable non-small cell lung cancer.”

“Today, we’ve made a significant step forward with the approval of the first anti-PD-1 therapy in Canada for the perioperative treatment of resectable non-small cell lung cancer. This approval highlights our commitment to expanding treatment options for lung cancer patients,” expressed André Galarneau, PhD, Executive Director & Vice President, Oncology Business Unit at Merck Canada. “We’re excited to continue this progress and collaborate with community partners to help patients affected by this disease.”

KEYNOTE-671 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03425643 ) evaluating KEYTRUDA® in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy given as neoadjuvant treatment and continued as monotherapy adjuvant treatment, versus placebo plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by resection and adjuvant placebo. Patients with previously untreated and resectable Stage II, IIIA, or IIIB (N2) NSCLC as assessed by the AJCC 8th edition were eligible for the trial. Patients were enrolled regardless of tumour PD-L1 expression. Patients with active autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment, a medical condition that required immunosuppression, a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis that required steroid treatment were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by stage (II vs. III), tumour PD-L1 expression (TPS ≥50% or <50%), histology (squamous vs. non squamous), and geographic region (East Asia vs. non-East Asia ). Patients were randomized (1:1) to one of the following treatment arms: Treatment Arm A: neoadjuvant KEYTRUDA® 200 mg on Day 1 in combination with cisplatin 75 mg/m2 and either pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 on Day 1 or gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle for up to 4 cycles. Following surgery, KEYTRUDA® 200 mg was administered every 3 weeks for up to 13 cycles. Treatment Arm B: neoadjuvant placebo on Day 1 in combination with cisplatin 75 mg/m2 and either pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 on Day 1 or gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle for up to 4 cycles. Following surgery, placebo was administered every 3 weeks for up to 13 cycles. The dual primary efficacy outcome measures were investigator-assessed event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). Secondary efficacy outcome measures included pathological complete response (pCR) rate and major pathological response (mPR) rate as assessed by blinded independent pathology review (BIPR). The trial was not designed to isolate the efficacy of KEYTRUDA® in each phase (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) of treatment. The trial demonstrated statistically significant improvements in EFS and OS for patients randomized to KEYTRUDA® in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy followed by KEYTRUDA® monotherapy compared with patients randomized to placebo in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy followed by placebo alone. At the first interim analysis, EFS efficacy results achieved statistical significance with a median follow-up time of 21.4 months (range: 0.4 to 50.6 months). At the second interim analysis, OS efficacy results achieved statistical significance with a median follow-up time of 29.8 months (range: 0.4 to 62.0 months). For complete information, refer to the KEYTRUDA® product monograph . About lung cancer in Canada Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in Canada . In 2024 alone, estimations indicated that there were approximately 32,100 new cases and over 20,000 deaths from lung cancer. Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 80-85% of all cases. In recent decades, the overall five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with lung cancer is on average 22% compared to nearly 90% for other commonly diagnosed cancers such as breast and prostate. About KEYTRUDA® KEYTRUDA® is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by helping increase the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumour cells. KEYTRUDA® is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumour cells and healthy cells. KEYTRUDA® was first approved in Canada in 2015 and currently has indications in several disease areas, including advanced renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer, non-small cell lung carcinoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, colorectal cancer, endometrial carcinoma, cervical cancer, esophageal cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, melanoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

"• Dricus du Plessis expresses his strong desire to fight in South Africa after his recent victory over American fighter Sean Strickland to retain his UFC middleweight title
• The 31-year-old emphasized that he would choose a Fight Night in South Africa over participating in International Fight Week, prioritizing a fight in Africa over global events
• The South African fighter also named the next opponent he wants to fight, stating that he wants to cement his status as the greatest of all time in the middleweight division

Dricus du Plessis successfully defended his UFC middleweight title for the second time after defeating American fighter Sean Strickland again at the Qudos Bank Arena in Sydney, Australia.

The South African combat sports star won the fight by unanimous decision after dominating the American in their five-round battle at the UFC 312 in the early hours of Sunday morning.

Du Plessis after his victory over Strickland, talked about his wish to bring his next fight to South Africa.

The 31-year-old has always dreamed of fighting in South Africa and wished his next bout in the middleweight category would be in his country.

He went on to thank the Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture, Gayton McKenzie, for what he's doing for sports in South Africa and opened up about how he has been working earnestly to bring his next fight to Mzansi.

Du Plessis names the opponent he wants next

After talks about Du Plessis going up against light heavyweight champion Alex Pereira, the South African has dismissed that and stated he's focused on facing Khamzat Chimaev next inside the octagon.

How much Du Plessis made compared to Strickland

Briefly News also reported on the earnings of Dricus du Plessis and Sean Strickland following their middleweight championship bout in Sydney, Australia.

DDP reportedly earned the biggest paycheck of his UFC career after the bout, marking a significant financial milestone for the South African fighter.

In contrast, the American fighter’s earnings was significantly way behind Du Plessis'.",2025-02-11T12:09:38+00:00,https://briefly.co.za/sports/football/209625-dricus-du-plessis-shares-plan-fight-south-africa-names-opponent-next/,4b14bd34dfa642f580728825eded6763
"• Over $500 million was lost to memecoin scams and rug pulls throughout 2024, with hackers primarily using social engineering tactics
• X (formerly Twitter) was the main platform for attacks, accounting for 75% of all incidents, while YouTube saw 19%
• The Mbappe scam resulted in a fake token reaching $460 million market cap before collapsing
• Social engineering led to equal amounts of rug pulls and phishing attacks, each representing 44% of total scams

A new report from crypto intelligence platform Merkle Science has revealed that investors lost more than $500 million to memecoin scams and rug pulls during 2024, with hackers primarily exploiting compromised celebrity social media accounts to carry out their schemes.

The research shows that social engineering emerged as the preferred method for crypto fraudsters, who focused their efforts on gaining unauthorized access to high-profile social media accounts. These accounts were then used to promote fake cryptocurrency tokens to millions of followers.

One of the largest scams involved French soccer star Kylian Mbappe’s X account. After gaining control of his profile, hackers promoted a fraudulent memecoin that quickly reached a market cap of $460 million before its value plummeted to zero in a classic rug pull scenario.

In another high-profile case, music artist Wiz Khalifa’s X account, with its 35.7 million followers, became a target. Scammers used his compromised account to promote a fake WIZ token, which reached a market value of $3.4 million before completely collapsing.

The data shows that social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, served as the primary battleground for these crypto scams, hosting 75% of all reported attacks. YouTube ranked second, accounting for 19% of the incidents.

Robert Whitaker, director of law enforcement affairs at Merkle Science, explained that these attacks demonstrated a high level of coordination.

The report’s findings indicate that rug pulls and phishing attacks were equally common, with each type making up 44% of the total reported scams. This suggests that criminals are using diverse tactics to defraud investors.

The sophistication of these attacks marks a shift from previous crypto scams. Instead of relying on anonymous accounts or fake websites, criminals are now leveraging the trust and reach associated with verified celebrity profiles.

The success of these scams often relied on the rapid spread of information across social media platforms, with many investors rushing to buy tokens before performing proper due diligence.

The Mbappe incident proved particularly costly for investors. The fake token’s market cap growth to $460 million happened within hours of the initial promotion, demonstrating how quickly these scams can escalate.

The Wiz Khalifa incident followed a similar pattern, though on a smaller scale. The fake WIZ token attracted millions in investment before its value disappeared, leaving investors with worthless digital assets.

The prevalence of these attacks on X suggests that the platform’s large user base and real-time nature make it an attractive target for crypto scammers. The high percentage of incidents on the platform indicates that crypto investors may need to exercise extra caution when encountering token promotions on this specific network.

YouTube’s 19% share of attacks represents another challenge for investors and platform operators alike. Video content has proven effective in convincing potential victims to participate in fraudulent schemes.

The equal distribution between rug pulls and phishing attacks (44% each) shows that criminals are adapting their techniques based on opportunity. Rug pulls capitalize on quick gains through market manipulation, while phishing attempts focus on stealing personal information or crypto wallet credentials.

Law enforcement agencies and crypto security firms continue to track these incidents, but the fast-paced nature of social media and crypto markets often allows scammers to execute their plans before preventive measures can be implemented.

The Merkle Science report reveals that most victims lost their funds within hours or even minutes of a scam’s launch, highlighting the speed at which these operations unfold.",2025-02-11T12:23:16+00:00,https://moneycheck.com/social-media-memecoin-scams-lead-to-500m-loss-in-2024/,428ceef806294249b3e2ff779a6b5eff

"Head of the Metropolitan Police Sir Mark Rowley said it is “absurd” that officers who are not fit to hold vetting cannot be lawfully sacked.

Sergeant Lino Di Maria successfully mounted a legal challenge, supported by the Metropolitan Police Federation, after having his vetting removed over sexual assault allegations, which he denies.

He was found to have no case to answer in respect of misconduct allegations, and argued that having his vetting removed without the accusations being proved is a breach of his right to a fair trial.

Sir Mark said: “Today’s ruling on the law has left policing in a hopeless position.

“We now have no mechanism to rid the Met of officers who were not fit to hold vetting – those who cannot be trusted to work with women, or those who cannot be trusted to enter the homes of vulnerable people.

“It is absolutely absurd that we cannot lawfully sack them.

“This would not be the case in other sectors where staff have nothing like the powers comparable to police officers.”

He called on the Government to take action to urgently change the rules around officers’ vetting.

Reacting to the ruling on Tuesday by Mrs Justice Lang, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: “This decision has significant implications for the work the Met is now doing to clean up the force, raise standards and rid the police of all those unfit to serve.

“I have long been clear that there can be no hiding place for those who abuse their position of trust and authority within the police.

“Working alongside the Met Commissioner, I want no let-up in the vital work being carried out to raise standards and rebuild public confidence in the Met.

“No-one who has failed vetting should continue to serve in the force and we will work closely with the commissioner, the Home Office and partners to assess the implications of this ruling.”",2025-02-11T12:13:07+00:00,https://www.thewestonmercury.co.uk/news/national/24926289.absurd-met-police-cannot-sack-officers-not-fit-hold-vetting---commissioner/,b32621256fc948b48cfc219b23907c48
"FOR the first time, a deadly brain swelling disease has been detected in British patients with no travel history - which proves it's now spreading locally.

The disease, which can cause brain inflammation, seizures, and long-term brain damage, was previously thought to be confined to mainland Europe, but has now made its way to the UK.

Ticks that spread it are most commonly found in most Europe, Russia, and parts of China and Japan.

But the virus has now been confirmed in British patients, as part of a study published in the journal Eurosurveillance.

Ticks are well known for transmitting disease such as Lyme disease.

But UK researchers have now warned a threat of TBE is emerging.

The new study looked at the first confirmed locally acquired human case of TBE in the UK and the public health implications.

The researchers conducted a retrospective analysis of cases diagnosed between 2015 and 2023.

They identified 21 TBE cases in humans in the UK between 2015 and 2023, including three possible, seven probable, and 11 confirmed cases.

Of these, 12 cases were diagnosed in 2022 to 2023.

One patient contracted TBE after tick exposure in Scotland, and another was infected in Yorkshire.

Both confirmed patients developed initial flu-like symptoms followed by neurological symptoms, including ataxia and confusion.

But they were able to recover with supportive care.

Surveillance also confirmed TBE in ticks collected from these locations, which supports evidence of an enzootic cycle - the continuous transmission of a disease within a specific geographic region.

Since 2023, testing for TBE has been expanded to include all referred cases of unexplained encephalitis, regardless of travel history, marking a significant change in public health policy.

The researchers believe while the overall risk remains low, TBE should now be considered in cases of unexplained encephalitis, even in patients without recent travel.

Many TBE infections don't cause symptoms, or symptoms are considered mild.

According to the NHS some people get flu-like symptoms about a week after being bitten, such as:

The symptoms usually go away on their own, but in a few people the infection spreads to the brain and causes more serious symptoms a few days or weeks later.
• pain when looking at bright lights
• weakness or loss of movement in part of the body

How to reduce your risk of TBE

There are things you can do to reduce your risk of being bitten by a tick when you're outside.

You should regularly check your clothes and skin for ticks that might be crawling on you, and brush them off before they can bite you.

Wearing light coloured clothing can make it easier to spot ticks.

Opt to walk on clearly defined paths so you can avoid brushing against plants that might have ticks on them.

Using an insect repellent such as DEET on your skin can also deter ticks from biting you.

And wearing long trousers and long-sleeved tops is advised.

There's no specific treatment for TBE. It's best to manage symptoms with rest, fluids, and pain relievers.

But TBE can be life-threatening if it spreads to your brain, and you'll need to be treated in hospital if you're seriously unwell.",2025-02-11T12:21:03+00:00,https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/33312528/deadly-brain-swelling-disease-uk-patients-without-travel-abroad/,27880270671f4964b20e7f20dcb826af
"Bali remains a deeply spiritual place. It even has a National Day of Silence, Nyepi, when everything comes to a standstill as residents give thanks to Mother Earth. This island lives an eternal dance between Sekala (the visible world) and Niskala (the energetic world): as above, so below; as within, so without.

Visionary from inception, Four Seasons Resort Bali at Sayan, 20 minutes west of Ubud, is a sanctuary of rice terraces surrounded by a dense tropical jungle that follows the meandering course of the rushing Ayung River. After 20-something years, its award-winning Sacred River Spa has just been completely revitalised to usher in a new era of well-being.

“There was a strong vision at the core of Sayan, right from the start,” says architect John Heah. The goal was to elicit a feeling, to create an experience. The degree of freedom he was given is almost unheard of, then or now. An integral part of his concept was working within the rice fields, which meant burying some of the rooms within the landscape. Of the main iconic structure, he says, “You can imagine it as a bowl of rice. I wanted people to arrive in the middle, to step inside the space within – suspended. It literally turns what you’re expecting on its head.”

The walk across the bridge, symbolising a pair of chopsticks, creates aerial awareness and subconsciously lets you let go of all preconceptions as you enter the resort. “You can think of the design, the movement and grace as my offering,"" he says, “A homage to the gods of this beautiful island – a lotus offering.” Entering Sayan creates a big reveal into the heart of this mystical jungle, where a tangle of vines, towering palms, and the rushing of the water takes you somewhere within yourself.

Just as he envisioned, one feels like a player in a carefully edited wide-screen epic, surrounded by drama. It feels larger than life and awes in a way that few manage to. Unexpected emotions rise to the surface. Since its opening in 1992, the property has gone to strength to strength. The Obamas took respite here after leaving the White House, and Julia Roberts’ whole family famously shacked up for months during the shooting of Eat Pray Love.

The valley is less steep here than further upstream, which lets more light enter the rooms and gardens. The grounds are quietly manicured by a machine-free army of gardeners using scythes to cut the grass or expertly coax the local flora into position. Harvests of sweet tasting ylang ylang are used to quench thirst; red ginger to ease headaches or settle stomachs; and garden croton for its various medicinal benefits. All around ,the fragrant Amazon lily, ubiquitous bamboos, and swathes of rice terraces add to the blanket of green.

“There are few places in Bali where the unseen energies are as powerful as here in the Ayung River basin,” says Regional Spa Director Luisa Anderson. Nature’s rhythms are forcefully felt in this valley. At its philosophical heart lie the seven chakras: “Luminous wheels of vitality that regulate the flow between our inner essence and the energies around us,” she explains.

An inherent wisdom to work from within is embraced in every treatment, including the powerful effect of sound on multidimensional well-being. All treatments begin and conclude with quartz crystal singing bowls tuned to 432 Hz, the intonation of nature. It acts like a shortcut or bio-hack to open awareness and connect to the surrounding nature. In addition, a dedicated sound healing room playing local Sayan playlists adds a further layer of vibrational healing through Solfeggio frequencies mixed with Ayung valley sounds.

The new spa houses seven private villas — including Sejuk (Water), Gending (Sound) and Teja (Fire). There is also a hybrid infrared and Swedish sauna treatment villa, along with a nail studio, relaxation pavilion, and Dharma Shanti bale. Enveloped beneath the jungle canopy, the villas are a sweet-spot balance of natural and modern, each with a bathtub hand-chiselled from Indonesian stone and state-of-the-art Lemi Portono electric heated massage beds. Old meets new. Sitting adjacent to the river is a peaceful new yoga pavilion named Dharma Satya after the Sanskrit for truth.

What are the signature treatments?

Six signature rituals have been designed to embrace Indigenous wisdom, including Restu Bumi, a spiritual cleansing featuring local instruments, herbs, and a warm gemstone massage, and the purifying Tirta Ening, which channels the healing power of Bali’s revered water element. Other treatments use Australian Synthesis Organics, a holistic plant-based, energy-imbued line of aromatherapy and skincare.

Fatigued guests, whether tired from the journey or life itself, are invited to take an al fresco air nap. Cocooned in a silk hammock suspended from the bamboo ceiling, soothed by the white noise of the adjacent Ayung and whispered wisdom of Ibu Fera, they fall into a deep theta state – somewhere between daydreaming and drifting off. Deeply soothing and nurturing, this is a not-to-be-missed relaxation technique that will leave you feeling refreshed and recharged and planning your next air nap.

Fera, the resident wellness mentor, is a former Buddhist nun who studied the Dharma in monasteries across Asia. Like most, she had me at ‘air nap’, and guests need no further persuasion to attend her daily meditation classes and life talks to awaken what she describes as “the greater peace inherent within us all.”

What makes it different?

Unlocking the layers of Bali's rich culture deepens guests’ connection – both practical and spiritual – to this land. This understanding extends to the respect Balinese hold for their daily sustenance. The hands-on class at Sokasi, the new riverside cooking school, shares the methods and ingredients behind traditional dishes normally reserved for important ceremonies and festivals. Timbungan is a cooking method where food, such a tender marinated chicken pieces, are inserted into a segment of bamboo is placed into or next to a fire to bake. A favourite at religious holidays in certain areas of Bali, it is served with belimbing sour-fruit and a fresh herb salad picked from the garden.

Anything else to mention?

Can You Keep A Secret? is the name given to the road-less-travelled excursion around Sayan. Stepping back in time into a pristine rice farming village situated in the shadow of a gargantuan banyan tree, where privileged access into the walled enclosure of a cluster of historic houses to spend time with a community of 25 people. They say that it takes a village to raise a child. In this unnamed village (to protect its identity from masses of bucket-list hunters), where the oldest is 90, and the youngest is four, we sat peacefully making canang sari – temple offerings fashioned from a banana leaf basket threaded with bamboo-staples and filled with marigolds, ylang ylang, red, white, and purple impatiens, while listening to first-hand tales of the Dutch and Japanese occupancies. From here, the floral offerings are taken to a secluded water temple to participate in a melukat bathing ritual. A highlight for all – but shh, keep it a secret.

In this pure, sacred space – bordered by Bali's longest and most revered river – the pulsating energy of river waters and Ayung valley foliage merges into soulful healing rituals; each treatment has been designed to unite body and mind with the rhythms of nature and help restore primal balance. By integrating ancient wisdom with cutting-edge wellbeing practices and products, the Sacred River Spa is flowing into a new era of holistic care.",2025-02-11T12:10:27+00:00,https://www.cntraveller.com/hotels/sacred-river-spa-four-seasons-resort-bali-at-sayan-spa-review,a17ffd37113f4bd086d77319c6afcbc0
"Prophet Clement Testimony, a well-known Ghanaian pastor, has delivered a powerful message to the President of Burkina Faso, Ibrahim Traoré.

 

 In a video posted on his YouTube channel on Monday, 10th February, 2025, the prophet shared a vision he claimed to have received from God concerning the Burkinabé leader.

 

 According to Prophet Clement Testimony, President Ibrahim Traoré should encourage his people to pray for him regularly and also focus on strengthening his spiritual life. The prophet revealed that in his vision, he saw a group of people secretly plotting to harm the president. He described the vision as a warning, urging the president to be spiritually alert and take necessary precautions for his safety.

 

 Prophet Clement Testimony further stated that President Traoré is currently regarded as one of the best leaders in the history of Burkina Faso due to his bold leadership style and efforts to bring positive change to the country. However, he noted that not everyone is pleased with the president’s success. Some individuals, both within and outside his circle, are reportedly unhappy with his leadership and are working against him.

 

 The prophet advised President Traoré to be very careful with the people he surrounds himself with, as not all of them have good intentions. He emphasized the importance of prayer as a tool to overcome spiritual attacks and maintain strong leadership.

 

 Ibrahim Traoré is a Burkinabé military officer and politician who became the transitional president of Burkina Faso in 2022 after leading a military coup that ousted the former leader, Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba. Born in 1988, Traoré is one of the youngest leaders in Africa. Before rising to power, he served as a captain in the Burkinabé army and was part of the forces fighting against Islamist insurgents in the country’s northern regions.

 

 Since assuming office, President Traoré has been praised by many for his efforts to restore security, fight corruption, and promote national unity. His leadership style is seen as firm and decisive, which has earned him both admiration and criticism. Some view him as a symbol of hope for Burkina Faso, while others are skeptical about military rule in the country.",2025-02-11T11:50:02+00:00,https://www.ghanaweb.com/blogs/spencerwan/Powerful-Ghanaian-Prophet-Sends-Message-to-Burkina-Faso-President-8969,e14f0ac133a6457eba42193dbaf7a113

"Standard Chartered has helped clients with their money across its 170 year history, not only in its home market, but across the world. How does Standard Chartered maintain its reputation as a global, and local, bank?

Demir Avigdor, managing director, head of private banking UK, Standard Chartered, believes wealth is growing, not only in volume, but geographically. The wealthy are spreading their funds across the world and the bank needs to meet them where they are needed.

PBI: What is Standard Chartered’s mission statement? You’re based in London but with a heavily international client base? What is the defining aspect of Standard Chartered?

Demir Avigdor: We’re a leading international wealth manager, with a world-class, diversified wealth management and cross-border banking proposition that serves the needs of affluent clients. We all know that we’re witnessing the most profound distribution of wealth, not only inter-generationally, but also across geographies.

The emerging markets, from predominantly Asia, Africa, Middle East, are growing much faster than in the West. The global wealth is shifting to those markets. With a presence in global wealth hubs (Hong Kong, Singapore, UAE, Jersey), we are perfectly positioned to capture growing wealth flows across our network. We are connecting our clients, either with each other or within the markets, or with our Corporate and Investment Banking arm, to meet their financial growth needs.

Why are people shifting to hubs like the Middle East and Africa?

The key answer here is that the emerging markets are growing much faster than the West. A recent report from the European Union showed that, in 1980 EU countries contributed 31% of the global GDP; and the US contributed 25%. Fast forward forty-five years and we note that the US portion is still 25%, but Europe’s portion is substantially reduced to 16%. So, where did the difference go? The portion of wealth being generated in Asia, Middle East and Africa is much bigger today in comparison.

There is far more wealth being created in Asia now; it is a major player in wealth generation. There is a flourishing generation of innovative entrepreneurs, especially in Singapore and Southeast Asia. Dubai has emerged successfully after the Covid-19 pandemic and the financial markets are registering record growth in the last two years.

Africa is growing fast. I appreciate it is coming from a very low base, but when you look at the growth rates, the African growth rate is much faster than the growth rates in the West.

Our strategy here is to really focus on those markets, to connect our clients across our regions in Africa, Middle East and Asia. To facilitate this, we organise a number of annual events for our Family Office clients. These are not typical Family Office seminars, but akin to networking events to connect global families with like-minded families in other geographies.

London is still a key player; it is an international hub. A lot of clients are attracted to the London lifestyle. They send their children for education here. They buy investment properties here. It’s very well regulated as a financial centre. By having an Advisory Centre in each Dubai, London, Singapore and Hong Kong, we give our clients a seamless international experience. We think Wealth Management must be multi-jurisdictional now.

You’ve explained the benefits, but what are the challenges of being multi-jurisdictional?

Standard Chartered operates in more than 50 markets with varying legal systems. We are well accustomed to operating in many regulatory frameworks with different complexities. I don’t know of another bank that deals with the same complexity that we do in terms of the variety of markets we are present in.

That must be a strong differentiator?

It is a huge differentiator. That affinity that we gain from being present in those markets becomes a strength for us when we talk to clients looking for a Private Bank to meet their needs. The clients know that our network has been 170 years in the making. We understand those markets and we are able to help their businesses, as well as their families. We are present locally, supporting those businesses, as well as their families. We’re more than just investment advisers, but trusted confidants and friends. That is probably the biggest differentiator that I emphasise in client meetings.

Do you see the wealth shift continuing?

Yes, I do see wealth continuing to shift East. Productivity in Asia and the Middle East is remarkable. There is so much energy. In the West, Europe is facing some challenges in terms of demographics and GDP growth.",2025-02-11T12:14:55+00:00,https://www.privatebankerinternational.com/features/standard-chartered-local-and-global-experts/,a07ded6af1c64df1ac8eed5a3e679780
"A woman has paid a heartfelt tribute to her brother, a devoted father-of-three and keen hiker who tragically died at the age of 40. Theresa Johnston, 42, told PA Real Life how her brother, Russ Johnston from Leicester, had embarked on a wild camping trip on Friday January 24 but never returned home as planned on Monday.

Russ, a talented tattoo artist, suffered a fatal pulmonary embolism at an Ambleside petrol station on Monday January 27. Despite the efforts of bystanders performing CPR, he passed away at the scene.

The family has since gathered over £3,000 through a GoFundMe campaign for Russ's children – Curtis, 21, Grace, 13, and Amelia, nine. ""Being as young as he was, he hadn’t thought about life insurance – it’s so they can get something for themselves in memory of their dad,"" Theresa said, revealing plans for the children to receive jewellery bearing Russ’s fingerprints.

She described the harrowing moment: ""He was on his way back to Leicestershire and he got to Ambleside and stopped for fuel and he’d refilled and went in and paid and when he was stepping into his van, he fell back and just collapsed.

“It was 5.30pm, people were coming back from work, on the commute, and people out at the petrol station were trying CPR to revive him and they called emergency services, but they just couldn’t get him back.

""We’d like to thank the people who tried so hard to save him and it feels better to know he wasn’t alone when he passed,"" added Theresa.

Russ had set out on his journey from Leicestershire on Friday, hiking to Windermere in Cumbria without any reported issues.

Theresa said: ""He dropped his girls at their mum’s on the Friday and he was due to come back on the Monday morning, and that’s when we found out there was a problem, because he had booked contractors to do some plastering in his shop on Monday and he didn’t turn up.""

“Because they knew where he planned to be, my cousin and his business partner went up to look for him, and when they couldn’t find him, they reported him missing.”

Theresa said the family found out in “under 10 minutes” that Russ had died, as his ex-partner rang them to explain the shocking news, and the family later discovered exactly what had happened from the police.

“My mum found out first. She phoned and then I went over to her. She rang my partner because my phone was on silent and she was just sobbing, and saying: ‘He’s gone’,” Theresa said.

“She’s gone into autopilot and she’s been trying to arrange his funeral. It’s been quite difficult because there were just the three of us after my dad passed, and now Russ is gone as well.

“I think as a parent, you never expect to have to do that for your own children.

“She was just shocked, because he was so young and he was overweight but he was active and there was just no way. We didn’t suspect anything like that was going to happen.

“He’d been doing 10,000 steps a day and he’d been sending pictures to my mum about how many steps he’d done and how many flights he’d done up, he was trying to make sure he was being active. None of us saw it coming.”

'He would always tell people where he was going and when he was due to come back'

Describing Russ’s personality, Theresa said he was “a character”.

“He had a wild sense of humour. He was always trying to push a little bit extra and doing things for the thrill, he enjoyed the Peaks, he enjoyed camping, he enjoyed pushing himself,” she said.

“When my mum went up to identify him, he had tattoos on the tops of his feet that were a bit risque and the person who prepared his body said: ‘I couldn’t help but laugh because you just saw his personality come through.’”

Russ owned a tattoo business in Leicester, By Design, with a business partner, and he had previously set up businesses in London, Essex and Kent, which he would eventually hand over to apprentices.

“People would always comment on his tattoos, because he was heavily tattooed, being a tattoo artist, but his business partner said all of his tattoos had been completed by his apprentices over the years.

“He’d never had one done professionally. He just used to let his apprentices practice on him,” said Theresa.

She said that hiking and wild camping were among Russ’s passions, ones he has enjoyed from “very young”.

“He spent so much time with so many people that this was his little escape. He’d go out into nature and wild camp, but he would always tell people where he was going and when he was due to come back,” she said.

Theresa said the last few weeks have been a “whirlwind” as Russ was loved by so many people who have wanted to express their shock and sadness at his passing.

“People that we didn’t know of were saying how shocked and sad they are and telling stories about him, that whenever they had a problem, he would just drop everything and be there,” Theresa said.

"The federal government has decided to tighten monitoring of individuals conducting financial transactions beyond their declared income, officials revealed on Tuesday.

Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Malik Amjed Zubair Tiwana informed the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance, chaired by Syed Naveed Qamar, that banks would assist in identifying discrepancies between declared income and actual transaction volumes.

“We will share taxpayer income and turnover data with banks using national identity card details,” Tiwana said.

“Banks will be required to report transactions that do not match the FBR’s records, but they will not be instructed to block them.”

Under the new mechanism, financial institutions must flag transactions exceeding the declared income in wealth statements or tax returns.

“The focus is on transparency. Any significant deviation will be reported to the tax authorities,” Tiwana added.

During the meeting, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) lawmaker Bilal Azhar Kayani explained that non-filers would be permitted to buy a house for the first time, while existing taxpayers could acquire new properties for themselves, their parents, or children.

He clarified that real estate purchases could be made using cash or equivalent assets, but all transactions would be subject to enhanced scrutiny.

Committee Chairman Naveed Qamar questioned why asset definitions had been included in the legislation, to which Tiwana responded that it was necessary to ensure transparency.

The move is part of Pakistan’s broader efforts to enhance tax compliance and combat financial irregularities.

Last week, FBR uncovered a tax fraud worth Rs 977 million carried out under the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS).

According to Director Customs Post Clearance Audit (PCA) South, Shiraz Ahmed, two fraudulent companies misused the EFS to evade taxes on the import of precious metal molds.

The companies allegedly imported 47 containers of high-value metals but manipulated records, declaring only 111 metric tons while 1,560 metric tons of imported goods went missing.

One company was found to have evaded Rs 499 million, while the second dodged Rs 478 million in taxes.

Further investigation revealed that the fraudulent companies were not even listed in FBR’s active registration database, raising concerns about regulatory loopholes.",2025-02-11T12:01:59+00:00,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2527889/fbr-to-monitor-bank-transactions-exceeding-declared-income,afd9e59db59a4027a47ef6b89447ed0c

"Plates London has made history as the first 100% vegan restaurant in the UK to receive a Michelin Star

Shoreditch-based vegan fine dining restaurant Plates London is one of 22 new one-star restaurants announced in the 2025 Michelin guide.

Founded by chef-owner Kirk Haworth and his sister Keeley, Plates London opened in its current location in July 2024, shortly after Haworth became ‘Champion of Champions’ on BBC’s The Great British Menu.

Haworth, a classically trained chef with experience in some of the world’s top kitchens, turned to plant-based cuisine after a Lyme disease diagnosis in 2016.

Despite his background, he resists labels, stating, “I’m trying to get rid of the word ‘vegan’, really. It’s all about flavour, excitement, and innovation.”

In a report about the restaurant, a Michelin inspector praised the chef’s approach, describing Haworth as “clearly passionate” about the restaurant, recognising that as a vegan himself, he’s “on a mission to make sure it’s as delicious as possible.”

And that mission appears to have been a success, as vegans aren’t the only patrons. The inspector noted that Plates London is buzzing with “curious and discerning diners, who are here not because of their diets but because they’ve heard it’s one of the most exciting new restaurants around.

“Yes, this is a groundbreaking, unique establishment within the UK’s dining scene. But more than that, it’s just a wonderful restaurant with MICHELIN-Star cooking that could convince the most committed of carnivores.”",2025-02-11T12:13:16+00:00,https://www.veganfoodandliving.com/news/plates-london-first-uk-vegan-restaurant-win-michelin-star/,3c28182f69fa4d55ae723b021fdcd97d
"(Bloomberg) -- Carlyle Group Inc. Chief Executive Officer Harvey Schwartz capped his second year in the top job hitting the goals he set for 2024.
• Nice Airport, If You Can Get to It: No Subway, No Highway, No Bridge
• In New Orleans, an Aging Dome Tries to Stay Super

Still, fourth-quarter profit narrowly missed estimates after the firm’s private equity earnings slipped. Schwartz now has to show he can build on early wins to keep growing beyond private equity while boosting returns at its marquee buyout arm.

Among a first round of targets Schwartz laid out early last year, the CEO hit them all. Carlyle boosted fee-related earnings by more than 28% to $1.1 billion in 2024, meeting its target, according to a Tuesday statement. Under Schwartz, Carlyle bumped up annual profit margins to 46% from 37%. And the firm took in the $40 billion-plus of inflows it aimed for.

Since Schwartz was appointed CEO in 2023, Carlyle has overhauled key private equity groups and tied dealmakers’ pay more closely to gains. He has been growing a team to reach more wealthy clients and broaden the firm’s reach beyond big pensions and institutions, all while cutting costs.

But shareholders are watching to see if Schwartz can enact more sweeping changes at a firm whose stock has lagged peers in the past two years. His key tasks include showing that the firm best known for private equity can find new sources of revenue and lift flagging returns in some strategies.

Carlyle’s fourth-quarter distributable earnings fell 4.7% during the period from the prior year. Helped by a lower tax rate, after-tax distributable earnings rose to 92 cents a share, missing Wall Street estimates of 94 cents a share, according to analysts polled by Bloomberg.

Private equity weighed on profit available to shareholders in the quarter. Though private equity dealmakers stepped up the speed of selling bets and returning cash to shareholders in the quarter, the gains didn’t all translate into a boost in earnings for shareholders. That’s because some funds haven’t hit key return thresholds that allow Carlyle to pocket its share of earnings.

In a reminder of Wall Street’s deal slump, distributable earnings for the group that includes Carlyle’s buyouts business, fell in 2024 for the third year in a row.

Credit, the firm’s largest business unit by assets, and its investment solutions segment reported distributable earnings rose 20.6% and 90% in the quarter, respectively, helping Carlyle offset some of the slump in the quarter.",2025-02-11T11:01:00+00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/carlyle-schwartz-met-2024-goals-110100527.html?.tsrc=rss,d0476042f39741caa17e6a69b159b657

"A story has emerged of an Indian-origin mom in who is being dubbed a "" ,"" and it is making rounds on social media. This inspiring story has gained widespread praise online. She wakes up at 4 AM to get ready for work and travels to her office five days a week. However, her commute doesn't take place on the road—she flies to work daily.

""I have two kids, both growing up. My oldest is 12, and my daughter is 11. As they grow, I feel the need for a mother to be around more often. With this arrangement, I can go home every day and see them at night,"" she told CNA Insider.

Previously, Racheal rented a home in Kuala Lumpur near her office and only returned to Penang, where she lived, once a week. However, with her kids at home, this routine was taking a toll on her work-life balance. In early 2024, she decided to start flying daily, which she says has allowed her to create a better balance between her personal and professional life.

In a video shared by the outlet, Kaur revealed that she wakes up at 4:00 AM every morning to get ready for work. She reaches the airport and boards her flight by 5:55 AM. Following the necessary procedures, she lands and reaches her office ""no later than 7:45 AM."" After a full day of work, she gets home by 8:00 PM.

The outlet reported that her daily travel, including food and accommodation, is cheaper when she flies than when she rents a house near her office. Moreover, she even manages to save money under her new travel routine. She claimed that she used to spend $474 (around Rs 42,000) a month, but now her expenses have gone down to $316 (around Rs 28,000) a month.

When asked what she does on her iPhone during the flight, she replied that her flight time is her ""me time."" She spends the first few minutes reflecting on life, then listens to music and admires nature until she reaches her destination. After landing, she walks to her office, which is five to seven minutes away.

When questioned about working remotely, she explained, ""Being surrounded by people… it’s easier to get a task done. You know… when you’re able to communicate with people face to face."" She also praised her employer, AirAsia, for being open to this arrangement, which allows her to maintain a work-life balance. “When I’m here, I focus 100 percent on my job, and when I’m home, I can focus 100 percent on my family.”

Kaur revealed in her interview that when people hear about her commute routine, they are usually amazed or shocked. While some express wonder, others often react in disbelief, saying, “Are you crazy?”

“It is exhausting to wake up every day at 4:00 AM. But the moment I reach home and see my kids, all that exhaustion disappears. It’s just wonderful,” Kaur told the outlet. She plans to continue her unusual commute to work for the ""foreseeable future.”",2025-02-11T12:11:53+00:00,https://www.timesnownews.com/viral/indian-origin-super-commuter-mom-flies-5-days-a-week-between-work-home-her-story-is-viral-article-118145288,c6abc6028f914b8fa02a5a6cefdc3217
"Pope Francis issued a major rebuke to the Trump administration’s mass deportation of migrants.

Francis warned that the programme to forcefully deport people purely because of their illegal status deprives them of their inherent dignity and “will end badly”.

He took the remarkable step of addressing the US migrant crackdown in a letter to US bishops who have criticised the expulsions as harming the most vulnerable.

Francis has also said governments are expected to do so to the limits of their capacity.

In the letter, Francis said nations have the right to defend themselves and keep their communities safe from criminals.

“That said, the act of deporting people who in many cases have left their own land for reasons of extreme poverty, insecurity, exploitation, persecution or serious deterioration of the environment, damages the dignity of many men and women, and of entire families, and places them in a state of particular vulnerability and defencelessness,” he wrote.

Citing the biblical stories of migration, the people of Israel, the Book of Exodus and Jesus Christ’s own experience, Francis affirmed the right of people to seek shelter and safety in other lands and said he was concerned with what is going on in the US.

“I have followed closely the major crisis that is taking place in the United States with the initiation of a programme of mass deportations,” Francis wrote.

“The rightly formed conscience cannot fail to make a critical judgment and express its disagreement with any measure that tacitly or explicitly identifies the illegal status of some migrants with criminality.”

It is one thing to develop a policy to regulate migration legally, it is another to expel people purely on the basis of their illegal status, he wrote.

“What is built on the basis of force, and not on the truth about the equal dignity of every human being, begins badly and will end badly,” he said.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said last week that more than 8,000 people had been arrested in immigration enforcement actions since Mr Trump took office on January 20.

Some have been deported, others are being held in prisons while others are being held at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba.",2025-02-11T12:19:10+00:00,https://jerseyeveningpost.com/morenews/worldnews/2025/02/11/pope-rebukes-trump-administration-over-migrant-deportations/,52cd9b6dd7ab4224947995bb25424bb4
"Dublin, Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Virtual Fitting Rooms - Global Strategic Business Report"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.



The global market for Virtual Fitting Rooms was valued at US$6.6 Billion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$18.9 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 19.3% from 2024 to 2030. This comprehensive report provides an in-depth analysis of market trends, drivers, and forecasts, helping you make informed business decisions. 



Virtual fitting rooms are transforming the retail industry by providing customers with an interactive and personalized shopping experience. These digital platforms allow users to try on clothes virtually through augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. By using a smartphone, tablet, or in-store kiosk, customers can see how different garments will look on their bodies without physically trying them on. This innovation addresses common shopping challenges, such as sizing inconsistencies and the time-consuming nature of fitting room queues. Virtual fitting rooms utilize 3D body scanning and sophisticated algorithms to create realistic and accurate representations of how clothes fit, offering a convenient and engaging solution for both online and offline shoppers.





The technology behind virtual fitting rooms has advanced rapidly, driven by improvements in AR, AI, and machine learning. Advances in AR and AI technologies have made virtual fitting rooms more accurate and accessible, enhancing the shopping experience and driving consumer adoption. High-resolution cameras and depth sensors enable precise body measurements, while AI-driven software enhances the accuracy of garment visualization by considering fabric properties and movement dynamics. Upgrades to AI algorithms within virtual fitting rooms represent a significant advancement in the retail industry.



Virtual fitting room domain is witnessing increasing use of machine learning (ML) and related algorithms for development of advanced apps to help users in virtually trying on clothing and yield precise body measurements for personalized experience. As AI continues to evolve, further innovations are expected to enhance the consumer shopping experience, offering a seamless blend of convenience, personalization, and inclusivity. AI solutions are tackling the issue of finding the right size online by using images and depth sensors to calculate accurate body measurements, offering a level of certainty similar to trying on clothes in a store.



Virtual fitting rooms are anticipated to register solid gains, driven by the intense competition in the retail industry that is prompting online retailers to embrace innovative solutions to improve customer engagement and business performance. The fashion landscape is poised to be shaped by rising attention on customer experience, digitalization and sustainability that are hot topics among young consumers. Virtual fitting rooms hold significant potential to help brands in scoring high in these areas. The technology is expected to move forward with continuously evolving shopper expectations and demands, indicating exciting avenues for innovative solutions.

The proliferation on smartphone applications has played a crucial role in making virtual fitting experiences more accessible worldwide. Shoppers now have the convenience of virtually trying on clothes through their mobile devices, enhancing their shopping experience and decision-making process. Growing integration of virtual fitting rooms by e-commerce platforms is also spurring market growth. Retailers are investing in virtual fitting technologies to differentiate themselves in a competitive market and to provide a seamless omnichannel shopping experience.

Furthermore, the growing emphasis on personalized shopping experiences is encouraging retailers to adopt virtual fitting rooms to meet the evolving expectations of tech-savvy consumers. The expansion of the fashion and apparel industry in emerging markets is creating new opportunities for the adoption of virtual fitting room technologies, supporting the overall growth of the market.

"Emirates Enhances Educational Opportunities in Zimbabwe by Donating Handcrafted Backpacks and Vital Supplies for Vulnerable Students

Education plays a pivotal role in shaping a nation’s future, driving economic growth and societal development. Despite significant strides in educational reforms, access to vital resources remains a major challenge for children and youth in many regions. Emirates, the world’s largest international airline, has stepped in to help bridge this gap by donating essential school supplies and exclusive, handcrafted backpacks from its ‘Aircrafted by Emirates’ collection to two Zimbabwean non-profit organizations.

Talal Al Gergawi, Country Manager for Zimbabwe, Emirates, said: “To provide the next generation with the essential tools to build a better future, we first must provide them the essential tools for their education. We wanted to provide better access to supplies and resources to help the students of Rose of Sharon and St Marcellins continue their studies, build a brighter future. Celebrating our shared values, we also provided a little piece of Emirates’ history, in the form of upcycled backpacks, demonstrating our longstanding and ongoing commitment to Zimbabwe’s culturally rich and diverse communities.”

In Zimbabwe, while efforts have been made to reform the education system, rural schools continue to face infrastructural deficiencies, widening the gap between them and urban institutions. St Marcellins Children’s Village Trust and Rose of Sharon are two organizations dedicated to supporting vulnerable youth in these underserved communities. Their work focuses on providing a safe, nurturing space for financially disadvantaged children, ensuring they have the opportunity to pursue their education.

With a long history of supporting youth, especially in education, Emirates donated backpacks made from upcycled materials sourced from its A380 and 777 aircraft, crafted in-house by Emirates Engineering. These limited-edition backpacks, part of the airline’s ‘Aircrafted by Emirates’ collection, were selected by the organizations to suit students of various age groups. Along with the backpacks, Emirates also supplied essential stationery such as pens, pencils, notebooks, calculators, and erasers.

Dr Fatima Maruta, Founder of Rose of Sharon, said: “We are grateful for the practical support that Emirates is giving to the children as it will make the world of difference.”

Further enhancing this donation, Emirates purchased culturally enriching books from the Plus One Readers series, written by Munyaradzi Gunduza, Blessed Mudzingwa, and Reggies Chapwanya. These books are designed to promote interactive learning and discussion among students, allowing them to engage with stories that reflect their own cultural backgrounds while expanding their academic horizons.

In total, 325 handcrafted backpacks were delivered to the two organizations by the Emirates team in Harare, who visited the communities and interacted with the students, contributing to the support of Zimbabwe’s future leaders.

This initiative underscores Emirates’ ongoing commitment to community support through its Emirates Airline Foundation, which has a long-standing history of championing children’s welfare programs. The airline’s support for St Marcellins, which cares for orphaned and homeless children, many of whom face physical disabilities and health challenges, is just one example of its broader efforts. Over 70 children currently under the care of St Marcellins will now also benefit from the Aircrafted backpacks, continuing the foundation’s positive impact on the community.

Sybil Macdonald, Co-founder of St Marcellins, said: “Emirates has been incredible as they have carried us over the past 7 – 8 years and as a result we have managed to educate these children. We are truly grateful for the help.”

‘Aircrafted by Emirates’ has become a key part of the airline’s broader sustainability and social responsibility initiatives. Materials from over 191 aircraft slated for retrofitting are being repurposed, with over 50,000 kg of materials expected to be recovered in total. Beyond Zimbabwe, Emirates has also extended its support to Zambia and Ethiopia, donating over 1,200 backpacks across Africa, with more to come in Asia in the near future.

Through these contributions, Emirates reinforces its commitment to making a meaningful difference by connecting communities, fostering education, and creating lasting relationships in the regions it serves.

"(Reuters) - Binance and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have jointly asked a court for a 60-day stay on the regulator's lawsuit against the crypto exchange, citing the potential impact of a newly launched task force.

In a court filing dated Monday, the parties said the task force, formed last month to work on crypto regulations, may ""impact and facilitate the potential resolution of this case"".

The stay could be an early sign of the SEC's pivot to a more crypto-friendly stance, reflecting President Donald Trump's pledge to make the U.S. a global hub for the industry.

In contrast, former SEC Chair Gary Gensler had termed the industry ""the Wild West"". Under him, the regulator sued Binance in June 2023, accusing the company and its former CEO Changpeng Zhao of artificially inflating trading volumes, diverting customer funds and misleading investors about its market surveillance controls.

Last year, a federal judge ruled that the majority of the lawsuit could proceed. The regulator is also locked in a dispute with another crypto exchange Coinbase.

""The Commission's handling of crypto has been marked by legal imprecision and commercial impracticality... It took us a long time to get into this mess, and it is going to take us some time to get out of it,"" SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who is leading the task force, said in a statement earlier this month.

Trump picked crypto-friendly Washington lawyer Paul Atkins as the new chair of the SEC, while prominent Republicans have ramped up efforts to curb what some have called ""Operation Chokepoint 2.0"" - the alleged denial of financial services to crypto companies.",2025-02-11T12:15:00+00:00,https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2025-02-11/binance-sec-request-pause-in-legal-battle-as-trumps-crypto-policy-takes-shape,1c59fb6d8de34956bf43b34ce83710ff

"NEW DELHI: Bangladesh has asked Adani Power to fully resume supplies from its 1,600-megawatt plant in India, a Bangladesh official said, after more than three months of reduced sales with supplies halved due to low winter demand and payment disputes.

Adani, which signed a 25-year contract under former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in 2017, has been supplying power from its $2 billion plant in India’s

 Jharkhand state. The plant, with two units each of 800 megawatts capacity, sells exclusively to Bangladesh.

The Indian company halved supply to Bangladesh on October 31 due to payment delays as the country battled a foreign exchange shortage. This led to the shutdown of one unit on November 1, resulting in the plant operating at about 42% capacity.

Subsequently, Bangladesh told Adani to keep supplying only half the power.

The state-run Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) said it had been paying $85 million a month to Adani to clear outstanding dues and has now told the company to resume supply from the second unit.

“As per our requirement today, they have planned to synchronise the second unit, but due to the high vibration, it didn’t happen,” BPDB Chairperson Md. Rezaul Karim told Reuters, referring to some technical problems that stopped the unit from restarting on Monday.

“Right now, we are making a payment of $85 million per month. We are trying to pay more, and our intention is to reduce the overdue. Now there is no big issue with Adani.”

BPDB and Adani officials were due to meet virtually on Tuesday following another meeting recently to work out various issues between them, said a source with direct knowledge of the matter who did not want to be named as he was not authorised to talk to the media.

An Adani Power spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In December, an Adani source said BPDB owed the company about $900 million, while Karim said at the time the amount was only about $650 million.

The pricing dispute revolves around how power tariffs are calculated, with the 2017 agreement pricing off an average of two indexes. Adani’s power costs Bangladesh about 55% more than the average of all Indian power sold to Dhaka, Reuters has reported.

A Bangladesh court has ordered an examination of the contract with Adani by a committee of experts, with results expected this month. This could potentially lead to contract renegotiations.

Last year, Bangladesh’s interim government accused Adani of breaching the power-purchase agreement by withholding tax benefits that the Jharkhand plant received from New Delhi, Reuters reported in December citing documents. Bangladesh officials also said they were reviewing the contract.

A spokesperson for Adani told Reuters at the time that it had upheld all contractual obligations with Bangladesh and had no indication Dhaka was reviewing the contract.

Karim has not replied to Reuters’ questions on whether the two sides have resolved their differences.

In November, U.S. prosecutors indicted Adani Group founder Gautam Adani and seven other executives for their alleged role in a $265 million bribery scheme in India. Adani Group has called the US allegations “baseless”.

In September, the Bangladesh government appointed a panel of experts to examine major energy deals signed by Hasina, who fled to New Delhi in August after deadly student-led protests.",2025-02-11T12:18:00+00:00,https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2025/02/11/bangladesh-seeks-full-power-supply-restoration-from-adani-plant/,395e0d0047134bf287bba42f1f2e344f
"The current owners invested $1 million in a renovation, but now want to live elsewhere.

A Bethesda mansion once owned by former Washington Wizards star Bradley Beal, which sold in late 2023 for $9.2 million not long after Beal was traded to the Phoenix Suns, is quietly back on the market.

The 13,500-square-foot home at 8913 Holly Leaf Lane, complete with indoor basketball court and outdoor tennis court, was renovated by its current owners, who moved to Greater Washington from out of town but have since decided they’d prefer to live in D.C. proper, said Robert Hryniewicki of HRL Partners at Washington Fine Properties, the listing agent. They are now asking $11 million for the property.

Hryniewicki is joined by Adam Rackliffe, Christopher Leary and Micah Smith of HRL Partners on the private listing.

The current owners are listed in Maryland records as Dean and Tara Seavers.

The home, sited on 2 acres in Bethesda’s Avenel community, a stone's throw from Congressional Country Club, includes six bedrooms and nine-and-a-half baths across its four levels (elevator included) plus an attached four-car garage. Winmar Construction built the mansion in 2016 and Beal, the Wizards' No. 2 all-time scorer, paid $7.8 million for it in August 2019, according to public records.

The main level features a formal dining room; living room and study separated by a two-sided gas fireplace; gourmet kitchen with wine bar and pantry; and a family room that opens to a covered terrace.

The primary suite, with its two walk-in closets, anchors the upper level, where it is joined by four additional ensuite bedrooms each with a walk-in closet, and a laundry room. On the lower level is a large rec room, exercise room and the sixth bedroom. And a floor below that is the full-sized sports court and additional storage.

Outdoors is a pool, hot tub, fire pit area and the tennis court.

Hryniewicki said the owners, whom he did not identify, spent $1 million to update the home, including the kitchen, bathrooms and certain flooring.

""They touched everything and it presents beautifully,"" the listing agent said.

As a private listing, the Holly Leaf Lane home will not appear in Bright MLS, the region's multiple listing service. New rules instituted last summer by Bright MLS allow for public marketing of exclusive or off-market listings, where before the MLS required listing any property within 24 hours of any public marketing. Check out our story from August 2024 on the impetus for the rule change and how it could impact local real estate sales.",2025-02-11T12:17:00+00:00,https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2025/02/11/bradley-beal-avenel-bethesda-holly-leaf-wfp.html,bc705f0d008e4835bbecfc787d00b643
"• Significantly high institutional ownership implies Blend Labs' stock price is sensitive to their trading actions
• 44% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders
• Ownership research along with analyst forecasts data help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock

If you want to know who really controls Blend Labs, Inc. (NYSE:BLND), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 49% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).

And things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$54m in market cap last week. The one-year return on investment is currently 39% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.

Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Blend Labs.

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Blend Labs?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.

As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Blend Labs. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Blend Labs' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.

Blend Labs is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that BlackRock, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 7.3% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.4% and 3.9%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. Additionally, the company's CEO Nima Ghamsari directly holds 3.6% of the total shares outstanding.

A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.

While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.

The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.

Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.

Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Blend Labs, Inc.. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$55m. Most would see this as a real positive. If you would like to explore the question of insider alignment, you can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.

With a 45% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Blend Labs. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.

While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

"Oil Production In Georgia Is Up, While Gas - Down

In 2024, oil production in Georgia increased, while natural gas extraction decreased. According to the Oil and Gas Corporation, 36.8 thousand tons of oil were produced in the country in 2024, which was 1,500 tons more than in 2023.

The state's share of the extracted oil was 14,200 tons. The corporation sells its share through auctions. As of the statistics, 2009 was an ordinary year in terms of oil production, when almost 60 thousand tons were extracted.

Between 2010-2013, an average of 50 thousand tons were extracted, and in subsequent years, extraction decreased relatively.

As for gas production - last year, 15.8 million cubic meters of gas were produced. The decrease is insignificant and amounted to 0.2 million cubic meters. The state's share of the produced gas was 5 million cubic meters. After 2020, the state receives 4-5 million cubic meters annually from local production.

According to the Ministry of Economy, 25 general and 8 activity licenses for the use of oil and gas resources were issued in 2024, to which 2 more licenses were added in 2025.

"Cooperation Minister Amit Shah announced that 26 PACS have been chosen to set up retail petrol and diesel outlets, with the government allowing PACS to operate retail fuel stations and LPG distributorship.

"In a significant military buildup, South Africa has dispatched hundreds of additional troops to the Democratic Republic of Congo, following the deaths of fourteen South African soldiers in clashes with Rwanda-backed rebels, Reuters reported.

Military transport aircraft have been spotted landing in Lubumbashi, carrying an estimated 700-800 reinforcement troops along with medical supplies and ammunition. The deployment comes at a critical moment as the M23 rebels maintain control of Goma, a strategic eastern city near the Rwandan border.

South Africa’s current presence in Congo, approximately 3,000 troops, serves both UN peacekeeping missions and a Southern African regional force. However, the intervention has faced mounting criticism at home, particularly after the fall of Goma left South African forces surrounded and poorly equipped, according to Reuters.

The situation has sparked concerns about a potential broader regional conflict, reminiscent of the devastating wars of the 1990s and 2000s that drew in multiple neighboring countries. The reinforcement appears designed to strengthen South Africa’s position as regional negotiations begin, while also providing support for troops cut off from supplies in Goma.

Critics, including opposition figures, question South Africa’s involvement, arguing that troops lack proper resources and equipment for the mission. Meanwhile, Uganda and Burundi have also reinforced their positions in eastern Congo, while Rwanda continues to deny accusations of supporting M23 rebels.",2025-02-11T12:16:40+00:00,https://medafricatimes.com/38762-south-african-military-bolsters-congo-presence-amid-rising-tensions.html,0c7bbcd31ebc47db8dd22936ccef3331

Paris: The majority owner of the emblematic Parisian department store Galeries Lafayette, Ginette Moulin, has died aged 98, the company told AFP Tuesday.

Moulin, who died on Sunday, was the granddaughter of Theophile Bader, who co-founded the store in 1894.

The net business worth of Moulin and her family is estimated at 4.05 billion euros ($4.18 billion), putting her in 34th place on the list of France's richest people compiled by the magazine Challenges.

Over her lifetime, Moulin saw six leadership generations running the Galeries Lafayette flagship store situated in the Opera district of the French capital.

She was ""a committed benefactor and a patron of artists who believed in the power of culture and creativity,"" the Galeries Lafayette said about her Tuesday.

Her father, Max Heilbronn, was arrested in 1943 and taken to the Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany, where he became friends with Etienne Moulin who later married Ginette. The couple had three children.

Beyond the main store, the Galeries Lafayette empire counts 56 other outlets in France, of which it runs 18 itself and 38 are managed as a franchise by partners.

But a shift towards online shopping, accelerated by Covid restrictions, has hurt Galeries Lafayette's business model that relies on footfall in bricks-and-mortar stores.

The group is planning to close two stores in the southern port city of Marseille because of recurring losses.

In 2023, it spun off another mythical Paris store, the Bazar de l'Hotel de Ville (BHV), situated near the capital's Marais district.

However, the group said last year that it hoped to bring sales volumes back to pre-Covid levels.",2025-02-11T12:20:15+00:00,https://thepeninsulaqatar.com/article/11/02/2025/galeries-lafayette-owner-ginette-moulin-dies-aged-98,d2d51e54d5b843158fb49763b349010a
"At the weekend, everyone talked about the spectacular action scenes they were shooting on the Chain Bridge. Keanu Reeves' crew was reported to be in possession of the Chain Bridge on Saturday with helicopters. But there are rumors that Halle Berry will soon join the Matrix Tetralogy star. Then on Sunday, the American WWE champion became a film star, John Cena has been on the Danube's most beautiful bridge, and has been shooting the Matchbox in Budapest for weeks. The events around the Chain Bridge attracted the passengers, where many people noticed John Cena's stunt. But after the duck, the fans himself spotted the actor himself.

A fan also picked up as John Cena gave a very nice gesture to a Hungarian boy. In a video posted on the ticks, it shows that the Hollywood movie star shakes hands with a little kid looking at the crowd. The short recording was recorded by the sister of the lucky little guy, so the joy in the family could certainly have been great after the incident. There would have been a lot of fans in the boy's place, but the actor had to go back to continue the film.

It is certainly not yet known what cinema filming caused the chain church to accommodate helicopters and stunts, but many suspect Matchbox. And this guess is becoming more and more secure with the presence of John Cena, as it has been known before that the actor would play in the motion picture adaptation of the car game.

However, not only did John Cena met the little boy in the body, but he also met the former wrestler in Budapest.

"Apartment owners struggling to recover maintenance dues may soon get relief. Currently, they must go to court, a costly and time-consuming process.

However, a proposal recommends allowing Maharashtra’s Co-operative Registrar to handle such cases. If approved, this change will simplify the process of recovering dues.

The proposal is part of amendments suggested for the Maharashtra Apartment Ownership Act, 1970. A 12-member committee, led by the Co-operation Commissioner, has recommended several changes, including granting the Registrar power to recover dues.

This report has been pending with the Housing Department for six months. If approved, it will help apartment owners by reducing legal hassles.

Currently, if a resident fails to pay maintenance, the matter must go to court. This process burdens other residents. The committee suggests setting up a grievance redressal panel to handle such issues efficiently.

3) Financial complaints will be handled by the accountant.

4) Legal complaints will go to the lawyer.

5) The panel will review cases and give verdicts.

6) If unsatisfied, members can appeal to the Co-operative Court.

"Kwasi Kwarteng Esq., a vocal member of the NPP Communications Team, has called upon the current government to conduct a comprehensive infrastructure audit on the numerous abandoned projects scattered across the country. In a bid to address inefficiencies, wastage, and mismanagement of public funds, Kwarteng emphasized the critical need for transparency and accountability in assessing the status of these projects. The proposed infrastructure audit aims to identify the reasons behind the abandonment of these crucial initiatives, evaluate their potential for completion or repurposing, and ultimately ensure that taxpayer resources are utilized effectively for the benefit of the nation.

 

 Kwarteng's plea for an infrastructure audit spotlights the pressing issue of abandoned projects that have languished due to various factors, including funding constraints, poor planning, lack of oversight, and changing priorities. By shining a light on these neglected endeavors, the government can gain insights into the root causes of project failures, learn valuable lessons for future infrastructure development, and take proactive steps to revitalize or repurpose these assets for the public good.

 

 The call for an infrastructure audit underscores the importance of good governance, fiscal prudence, and sustainable development practices in the management of public resources. Through a systematic review of abandoned projects, the government can demonstrate its commitment to accountability and transparency, instill public confidence in the stewardship of public funds, and pave the way for more effective project management strategies in the future.

 

 As a member of the NPP Communication Team, Kwarteng's advocacy for an infrastructure audit aligns with the party's principles of accountability, performance-driven governance, and inclusive development. By urging the government to proactively address the issue of abandoned projects, Kwarteng seeks to foster a culture of responsibility, efficiency, and results-oriented leadership within the public administration.

 

 In the wake of Kwarteng's impassioned plea, stakeholders await the government's response to the proposal for an infrastructure audit, anticipating a concrete plan of action to assess, address, and resolve the challenges posed by abandoned projects. The outcomes of such an audit have the potential to inform policy decisions, improve project implementation processes, and enhance the delivery of vital infrastructure projects that benefit communities and drive economic growth.

 

 In conclusion, Kwasi Kwarteng Esq.'s advocacy for an infrastructure audit on abandoned projects underscores the imperative for transparency, accountability, and effective governance in the management of public infrastructure initiatives. By prioritizing the evaluation and revitalization of these dormant assets, the government can demonstrate its commitment to prudent resource allocation, sustainable development practices, and the efficient delivery of public services to the benefit of all citizens.

"Tim Steidten really disappointed in his role at West Ham United, and now it’s down to Graham Potter to clear up the German’s mess.

Julen Lopetegui and David Moyes are to blame as well, but Tim Steidten oversaw some truly horrific deals during his time at West Ham.

Graham Potter brought in his recruitment guru Kyle Macaulay when he arrived at the London Stadium, and as a result, Steidten was sent packing.

The Hammers head coach and his sidekick face a hugely important summer window ahead, and they are allegedly planning a big squad revamp at the end of the season.

Thta really is needed, considering how poorly the current squad has been put together.

Signings like Konstantinos Mavropanos, Niclas Fullkrug and Luis Guilherme have really set us back as a club.

Everything needs to change at the London Stadium regarding how we identify targets.

However, Potter’s latest comments have hardly inspired confidence.

The German is long gone now, and the future is very bright with Potter at the helm.

It will be very interesting indeed to see the approach he takes to player recruitment when the summer transfer window opens.

However, he has just made a concerning admission regarding exactly that, albeit perhaps without meaning to.

When speaking on the Iron Cast podcast, Potter suggested that he is not prepared to completely rip up all of the work that went into identifying potential targets before he arrived at the London Stadium:

“It’s important we don’t come in and undo the good work the club has done before we arrived,” Potter explained.

“Maybe the club has been scouting a player for six months and has done their research, so it’s important we don’t throw that progress away.”

Without meaning to, the Hammers head coach has suggested that he’s open to signing players identified by the recently departed Steidten.

I’m not sure that’s the right way to go, given the fact that Steidten was dismissed after a really poor record when it comes to his signings for the Hammers.

Potter and Macaulay must take a new approach

I’m hoping that Potter and his sidekick Macaulay opt to go down an entirely different route when it comes to player recruitment.

I would like to see the Hammers target players with younger, more dynamic and energetic profiles.

Wouldn’t it be great to sign players with huge potential BEFORE they become stars, just as teams like Brighton and Brentford do.

It’s a much more sustainable model than the one we currently operate under.

We have the oldest squad in the Premier League right now, and we sign the oldest players on average in the top flight as well.

Something drastic has to change, if we are to make some real, discernible progress as a club.

In order to do that though, it will be a necessity for Graham Potter to take a different approach to the one used by Tim Steidten before him.",2025-02-11T12:15:01+00:00,https://www.hammers.news/news/west-ham-boss-graham-potter-inadvertently-makes-shock-tim-stediten-admission/,95537d86776046cc9e9b656f6f77e333
"RACIST graffiti in Andersonstown and Lenadoon areas of West Belfast has been condemned.

'Locals only' appeared at a hoarding at Casement Park on the Andersonstown Road as well as on a wall in Lenadoon.

West Belfast MP Paul Maskey branded the graffiti as ""disgusting and deplorable"".

“Racism, wherever it raises its ugly head, must be opposed, challenged and stamped out,"" he added.

“West Belfast is a proudly welcoming, inclusive and diverse community. The majority of the people I speak to each and every day stand against racism, hatred, intimidation and discrimination.

“We will continue to champion and embrace the huge positives of diversity, and stand with everyone who calls this island home.”

"Cake Design by Holly Miller retained their “cakery crown” this year at the 2025 Wedding Industry Awards ceremony at The Underglobe in London, held at the end of January.

Founder Holly Miller said: “I just can't quite believe it. It really does feel like a dream.”

According to Holly, the process leading up to the achievement involved her having to submit ten of her favourite cake designs along with videos.

She also had to answer ten questions about the business and why they do what they do.

Her and her team then had to ask all their clients to provide feedback and give them scores based on a number of elements out of 10.

“The more votes you get and the better the quality, the more you will score. Everything is then judged by the judging panel of industry experts.

“I was super super super, nervous with trying to retain my cakey crown. Especially after winning the top prize last year.”

Holly and her team then competed against nine other cake designers from across the country.

She added: “It’s a pretty big event and the awards are held in high esteem due to their reputation of being pretty tough to do well in.

“Only a very select few go straight in and win nationals twice in a row. Many people enter numerous times before actually winning regionals, let alone nationals.”

Before the ceremony, Holly got her hair and makeup done in Bath before heading to London, she also wore Temperley again for the second year in a row to the event.

She said: “Alice is Somerset based, so I wanted to fly the flag for our amazing County and the super talented people and skills we have here in the South West.”

When reflecting about the event afterwards, Holly said to the County Gazette: “I don't really feel it has properly sunk in yet. I don't think it really did last year at all.

“I just can't quite believe it. It really does feel like a bit of a dream. I feel it does show and prove that if you put yourself and invest whole heartedly into something. You really can achieve what you want.

“I love my business and get so much pleasure out of doing what I do and creating fabulous cakes for the most beautiful and amazing of couples.”",2025-02-11T12:15:00+00:00,https://www.somersetcountygazette.co.uk/news/24926364.somerset-business-named-national-winner-two-years-row/,fda00c2bd3534cb79bd4a598cb83f80d
"Lukasz Ratke of Dunclug Park was convicted at Ballymena Magistrates’ Court on Monday 3 February 2025 with the Magistrate imposing a £300 fine and ordering Mr Latke to pay £300 costs fees, £23 Court fees costs and a £15 offender levy.

The charge was brought against Mr Latke by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council under the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act (NI) 2011.

Proceedings followed an investigation by a Council Enforcement Officer who witnessed Mr Latke allowing his Golden Labrador, which was off a lead at the time, to foul on a green area in Dunclug Park on 31 July 2024.

After Mr Latke failed to clean up after his dog, he was approached by a Council Enforcement Officer who made him aware of the offence. Mr Latke was issued a fixed penalty notice of £200 which, if paid, would have prevented prosecution by the Council.

Mr Latke failed to pay this fixed penalty and the case therefore proceeded to Court where the Magistrate imposed this fine and costs.

Commenting on the case a spokesperson for Mid and East Antrim Borough Council said:

“The Council operates a rigorous enforcement policy to minimise the impact of these offences and issues fixed penalties on those responsible.

“In cases, like this, where individuals fail to pay the fixed penalty, the Council will prosecute for such offences which I hope serves as a warning about the importance to clean up after your dog.”",2025-02-11T11:59:27.363000+00:00,https://www.loveballymena.online/post/ballymena-man-fined-300-for-permitting-his-dog-to-foul,32527751bd134454a8297ad241d66c32
