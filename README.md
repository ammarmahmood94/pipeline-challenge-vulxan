**Task: News Article Processing Pipeline**

### Overview:
You are provided with a list of news articles (existing in folder data). Your task is to develop a pipeline that processes these articles and converts them into structured information. The pipeline should include preprocessing, named entity recognition (NER), topic classification, sentiment analysis, summarization, keyword extraction, and structured data storage.

### Task Requirements:
#### **1. Preprocessing:**
- Filter articles that are written in English.
- Exclude articles less than 1000 characters.

#### **2. Named Entity Recognition (NER):**
- Identify key entities such as:
  - **Persons**
  - **Organizations**
  - **Locations**
  - **Dates**
  - **Events**

#### **3. Topic Classification:**
- Assign each article to a predefined category using NLP models.
- Example categories include:
  - Politics
  - Sports
  - Business
  - Technology
  - Health
  - Entertainment
  - Science

#### **4. Sentiment Analysis:**
- Determine the overall sentiment of the article:
  - **Positive**
  - **Negative**
  - **Neutral**

#### **5. Summarization:**
- Generate a concise summary of each article while retaining key points.

#### **6. Keyword Extraction:**
- Extract important keywords using techniques such as:
  - **TF-IDF**
  - **RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction)**
  - **Other NLP-based techniques**

#### **7. Output Structured Information:**
- Convert processed data into structured JSON format and store it in a database.

#### **Proposed JSON Output Format:**
```json
{
  "title": "Sample News Title",
  "url": "https://example.com/news-article",
  "published_date": "2024-02-11",
  "source": "BBC News",
  "category": "Technology",
  "summary": "This is a short summary of the article.",
  "sentiment": "Positive",
  "keywords": ["AI", "Machine Learning", "Tech Industry"],
  "entities": {
    "persons": ["John Doe"],
    "organizations": ["OpenAI"],
    "locations": ["San Francisco"],
    "dates": ["2024-02-10"],
    "events": ["AI Conference 2024"]
  },
  "full_text": "Complete preprocessed article text."
}
```

### **Webhook Implementation:**
A webhook should be developed to accept articles as input, initiate the processing pipeline, and store the results in the database.

#### **API Endpoint:**
- **`POST /ingest_article`**
  - Accepts the article content in the request body.
  - Initiates the processing pipeline.
  - Stores the structured data in the database.

### **Deployment Requirements:**
The following services should be deployed on Kubernetes. Kubernetes provides a scalable and efficient way to manage containerized applications. For local development and testing, you can use lightweight versions such as Minikube or K3s on your own system. Once validated, artifacts can be pushed to a Git repository for version control and collaboration before deploying to a production-grade Kubernetes cluster.

#### **1. Application Service:**
- Deploy **3 replicas** of the application.
- All replicas should receive articles from the webhook endpoint and process them in parallel.
- Implement **load balancing** to distribute articles evenly among the replicas (e.g., when three articles are sent, each replica should process one).

#### **2. Database Service:**
- Deploy a **database service** to store processed articles.
- Recommended databases:
  - **MongoDB**
  - **Elasticsearch**

### **Recommended Technologies:**
- **Elasticsearch** (for storing the processed data)
- **Langchain** (for NLP and data processing)
- **OpenAI LLM** (for text processing tasks like summarization, NER, and sentiment analysis)

This pipeline should efficiently process and structure news articles, ensuring scalability and robustness in a Kubernetes environment.
